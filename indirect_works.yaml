      abstract: Abstract   An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted thermal infrared
        (TIR) camera’s ability to delineate landfill gas (LFG) emission hotspots
        was evaluated in a field test at two Danish landfills (Hedeland landfill
        and Audebo landfill). At both sites, a test area of 100m 2  was
        established and divided into about 100 measuring points. The
        relationship between LFG emissions and soil surface temperatures were
        investigated through four to five measuring campaigns, in order to cover
        different atmospheric conditions along with increasing, decreasing and
        stable barometric pressure. For each measuring campaign, a TIR image of
        the test area was obtained followed by the measurement of methane (CH 4
        ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions at each measuring point, using a
        static flux chamber. At the same time, soil temperatures measured on the
        surface, at 5cm and 10cm depths, were registered. At the Hedeland
        landfill, no relationship was found between LFG emissions and surface
        temperatures. In addition, CH 4  emissions were very limited, on average
        0.92–4.52g CH 4 m −2 d −1 , and only measureable on the two days with
        decreasing barometric pressure. TIR images from Hedeland did not show
        any significant temperature differences in the test area. At the Audebo
        landfill, an area with slightly higher surface temperatures was found in
        the TIR images, and the same pattern with slightly higher temperatures
        was found at a depth of 10cm. The main LFG emissions were found in the
        area with the higher surface temperatures. LFG emissions at Audebo were
        influenced significantly by changes in barometric pressure, and the
        average CH 4  emissions varied between 111gm −2 d −1  and 314gm −2 d −1
        , depending on whether the barometric pressure gradient had increased or
        decreased, respectively. The temperature differences observed in the TIR
        images from both landfills were limited to between 0.7°C and 1.2°C. The
        minimum observable CH 4  emission for the TIR camera to identify an
        emission hotspot was 150g CH 4 m −2 d −1  from an area of more than 1m 2
        .

      abstract: In this paper, we present an estimation-based route planning (ERP)
        method for chemical source searching using a wheeled mobile robot and
        validate its effectiveness with outdoor field experiments. The ERP
        method plans a dynamic route for the robot to follow to search for a
        chemical source according to time-varying wind and an estimated
        chemical-patch path (C-PP), where C-PP is the historical trajectory of a
        chemical patch detected by the robot, and normally different from the
        chemical plume formed by the spatial distribution of all chemical
        patches previously released from the source. Owing to the limitations of
        normal gas sensors and actuation capability of ground mobile robots, it
        is quite hard for a single robot to directly trace the intermittent and
        rapidly swinging chemical plume resulting from the frequent and random
        changes of wind speed and direction in outdoor field environments. In
        these circumstances, tracking the C-PP originating from the chemical
        source back could help the robot approach the source. The proposed ERP
        method was tested in two different outdoor fields using a wheeled mobile
        robot. Experimental results indicate that the robot adapts to the
        time-varying airflow condition, arriving at the chemical source with an
        average success rate and approaching effectiveness of about 90% and

      abstract: Finding sources of airborne chemicals with mobile sensing systems
        finds applications across safety, security, environmental monitoring,
        and medical domains. In this paper, we present an algorithm based on
        Source Term Estimation for odor source localization that is coupled with
        a navigation method based on partially observable Markov decision
        processes. We propose a novel strategy to balance exploration and
        exploitation in navigation. Moreover, we study two variants of the
        algorithm, one exploiting a global and the other one a local framework.
        The method was evaluated through high-fidelity simulations and in a wind
        tunnel emulating a quasi-laminar air flow in a controlled environment,
        in particular by systematically investigating the impact of multiple
        algorithmic and environmental parameters (wind speed and source release
        rate) on the overall performance. The outcome of the experiments showed
        that the algorithm is robust to different environmental conditions in
        the global framework, but, in the local framework, it is only successful
        in relatively high wind speeds. In the local framework, on the other
        hand, the algorithm is less demanding in terms of energy consumption as
        it does not require any absolute positioning information from the
        environment and the robot travels less distance compared to the global
        framework.

        sources of airborne chemicals with mobile sensing systems finds
        applications across safety, security, environmental monitoring, and
        medical domains. In this paper, we present an algorithm based on Source
        Term Estimation for odor source localization that is coupled with a
        navigation method based on partially observable Markov decision
        processes. We propose a novel strategy to balance exploration and
        exploitation in navigation. Moreover, we study two variants of the
        algorithm, one exploiting a global and the other one a local framework.
        The method was evaluated through high-fidelity simulations and in a wind
        tunnel emulating a quasi-laminar air flow in a controlled environment,
        in particular by systematically investigating the impact of multiple
        algorithmic and environmental parameters (wind speed and source release
        rate) on the overall performance. The outcome of the experiments showed
        that the algorithm is robust to different environmental conditions in
        the global framework, but, in the local framework, it is only successful
        in relatively high wind speeds. In the local framework, on the other
        hand, the algorithm is less demanding in terms of energy consumption as
        it does not require any absolute positioning information from the
        environment and the robot travels less distance compared to the global
        framework.}}

      title: Performance assessment of a low-cost PM2.5 Sensor for a near four-month

      abstract: "The very low-cost Nova particulate matter (PM) sensor SDS011 has
        recently drawn attention for its use for measuring PM mass
        concentration, which is frequently used as an indicator of air quality.
        However, this sensor has not been thoroughly evaluated in real-world
        conditions and its data quality is not well documented. In this study,
        three SDS011 sensors were evaluated by co-locating them at an official,
        air quality monitoring station equipped with reference-equivalent
        instrumentation in Oslo, Norway. The sensors’ measurement results for
        PM2.5 were compared with data generated from the air quality monitoring
        station over almost a four-month period. Five performance aspects of the
        sensors were examined: operational data coverage, linearity of response
        and accuracy, inter-sensor variability, dependence on relative humidity
        (RH) and temperature (T), and potential improvement of sensor accuracy,
        by data calibration using a machine-learning method. The results of the
        study are: (i) the three sensors provide quite similar results, with
        inter-sensor correlations exhibiting R values higher than 0.97; (ii) all
        three sensors demonstrate quite high linearity against officially
        measured concentrations of PM2.5, with R2 values ranging from 0.55 to
        0.71; (iii) high RH (over 80%) negatively affected the sensor response;
        (iv) data calibration using only the RH and T recorded directly at the
        three sensors increased the R2 value from 0.71 to 0.80, 068 to 0.79, and
        0.55 to 0.76. The results demonstrate the general feasibility of using
        these low cost SDS011 sensors for indicative PM2.5 monitoring under
        certain environmental conditions. Within these constraints, they further
        indicate that there is potential for deploying large networks of such
        devices, due to the sensors’ relative accuracy, size and cost. This
        opens up a wide variety of applications, such as high-resolution air
        quality mapping and personalized air quality information services.
        However, it should be noted that the sensors exhibit often very high
        relative errors for hourly values and that there is a high potential of
        abusing these types of sensors if they are applied outside the
        manufacturer-provided specifications particularly regarding relative
        humidity. Furthermore, our analysis covers only a relatively short time
        period and it is desirable to carry out longer-term studies covering a
        wider range of meteorological conditions."

      abstract: This paper describes the development and validation of the currently
        smallest aerial platform with olfaction capabilities. The developed
        Smelling Nano Aerial Vehicle (SNAV) is based on a lightweight commercial
        nano-quadcopter (27 g) equipped with a custom gas sensing board that can
        host up to two in situ metal oxide semiconductor (MOX) gas sensors. Due
        to its small form-factor, the SNAV is not a hazard for humans, enabling
        its use in public areas or inside buildings. It can autonomously carry
        out gas sensing missions of hazardous environments inaccessible to
        terrestrial robots and bigger drones, for example searching for victims
        and hazardous gas leaks inside pockets that form within the wreckage of
        collapsed buildings in the aftermath of an earthquake or explosion. The
        first contribution of this work is assessing the impact of the
        nano-propellers on the MOX sensor signals at different distances to a
        gas source. A second contribution is adapting the ‘bout’ detection
        algorithm, proposed by Schmuker et al. (2016) to extract specific
        features from the derivative of the MOX sensor response, for real-time
        operation. The third and main contribution is the experimental
        validation of the SNAV for gas source localization (GSL) and mapping in
        a large indoor environment (160 m2) with a gas source placed in
        challenging positions for the drone, for example hidden in the ceiling
        of the room or inside a power outlet box. Two GSL strategies are
        compared, one based on the instantaneous gas sensor response and the
        other one based on the bout frequency. From the measurements collected
        (in motion) along a predefined sweeping path we built (in less than 3
        min) a 3D map of the gas distribution and identified the most likely
        source location. Using the bout frequency yielded on average a higher
        localization accuracy than using the instantaneous gas sensor response
        (1.38 m versus 2.05 m error), however accurate tuning of an additional
        parameter (the noise threshold) is required in the former case. The main
        conclusion of this paper is that a nano-drone has the potential to
        perform gas sensing tasks in complex environments.

      abstract: In disaster scenarios, where toxic material is leaking, gas source
        localization is a common but also dangerous task. To reduce threats for
        human operators, we propose an intelligent sampling strategy that
        enables a multi-robot system to autonomously localize unknown gas
        sources based on gas concentration measurements. This paper discusses a
        probabilistic, model-based approach for incorporating physical process
        knowledge into the sampling strategy. We model the spatial and temporal
        dynamics of the gas dispersion with a partial differential equation that
        accounts for diffusion and advection effects. We consider the exact
        number of sources as unknown, but assume that gas sources are sparsely
        distributed. To incorporate the sparsity assumption we make use of
        sparse Bayesian learning techniques. Probabilistic modeling can account
        for possible model mismatch effects that otherwise can undermine the
        performance of deterministic methods. In the paper we evaluate the
        proposed gas source localization strategy in simulations using synthetic
        data. Compared to real-world experiments, a simulated environment
        provides us with ground truth data and reproducibility necessary to get
        a deeper insight into the proposed strategy. The investigation shows
        that (i) the probabilistic model can compensate imperfect modeling; (ii)
        the sparsity assumption significantly accelerates the source
        localization; and (iii) a-priori advection knowledge is of advantage for
        source localization, however, it is only required to have a certain
        level of accuracy. These findings will help in the future to
        parameterize the proposed algorithm in real world applications.

      abstract: Emergency personnel, such as firefighters, bomb technicians, and urban
        search and rescue specialists, can be exposed to a variety of extreme
        hazards during the response to natural and human-made disasters. In many
        of these scenarios, a risk factor is the presence of hazardous airborne
        chemicals. The recent and rapid advances in robotics and sensor
        technologies allow emergency responders to deal with such hazards from
        relatively safe distances. Mobile robots with gas-sensing capabilities
        allow to convey useful information such as the possible source positions
        of different chemicals in the emergency area. However, common gas
        sampling procedures for laboratory use are not applicable due to the
        complexity of the environment and the need for fast deployment and
        analysis. In addition, conventional gas identification approaches, based
        on supervised learning, cannot handle situations when the number and
        identities of the present chemicals are unknown. For the purpose of
        emergency response, all the information concluded from the gas detection
        events during the robot exploration should be delivered in real time. To
        address these challenges, we developed an online gas-sensing system
        using an electronic nose. Our system can automatically perform
        unsupervised learning and update the discrimination model as the robot
        is exploring a given environment. The online gas discrimination results
        are further integrated with geometrical information to derive a
        multi-compound gas spatial distribution map. The proposed system is
        deployed on a robot built to operate in harsh environments for
        supporting fire brigades, and is validated in several different
        real-world experiments of discriminating and mapping multiple chemical
        compounds in an indoor open environment. Our results show that the
        proposed system achieves high accuracy in gas discrimination in an
        online, unsupervised, and computationally efficient manner. The
        subsequently created gas distribution maps accurately indicate the
        presence of different chemicals in the environment, which is of
        practical significance for emergency response.

      abstract: A new nonparametric Bayesian-based motion planning algorithm for
        autonomous plume source term estimation (STE) and source seeking (SS) is
        presented in this paper. The algorithm is designed for mobile robots
        equipped with gas concentration sensors. Specifically, robots coordinate
        and utilize a Gaussian-plume likelihood model in a Bayesian-based STE
        process, then they simultaneously search for and navigate toward the
        source through model based, bioinspired SS methods such as
        biased-random-walk and surge-casting. Compared with the state-of-the-art
        Bayesian- and sensor-based STE/SS motion planners, the strategy
        described takes advantage of coordination between multiple robots and
        the estimated plume model for faster and more robust SS, rather than
        rely on direct or filtered sensor measurements. A set of Monte Carlo
        simulation studies are conducted to compare the performance between the
        uncoordinated and coordinated algorithms for different robot team sizes
        and starting conditions. Additionally, the algorithms are validated
        experimentally through a laboratory-safe, realistic humid-air plume that
        behaves similar to a gas plume, to test STE and SS using mobile ground
        robots equipped with humidity sensors. Simulation and experimental
        results show consistently that the algorithm involving coordination
        outperforms traditional bioinspired SS algorithms and it is
        approximately twice as fast as the uncoordinated case. Finally, the
        plume source is distorted to study the algorithm's limitations and
        impact on STE and SS, where results show that even for distorted plumes,
        useful source localization information can be obtained.

      abstract: "Locating odour sources with robots is an interesting problem with
        many important real-world applications. In the past years, the robotics
        community has adapted several bio-inspired strategies to search for
        odour sources in a variety of environments. This work studies and
        compares some of the most common strategies from a behavioural
        perspective with the aim of knowing: (1) how different are the
        behaviours exhibited by the strategies for the same perceptual state;
        and (2) which are the most consensual actions for each perceptual state
        in each environment. The first step of this analysis consists of
        clustering the perceptual states, and building histograms of the actions
        taken for each cluster. In case of (1), a histogram is made for each
        strategy separately, whereas for (2), a single histogram containing the
        actions of all strategies is produced for each cluster of states.
        Finally, statistical hypotheses tests are used to find the statistically
        significant differences between the behaviours of the strategies in each
        state. The data used for performing this study was gathered from a
        purpose-built simulator which accurately simulates the real-world
        phenomena of odour dispersion and air flow, whilst being sufficiently
        fast to be employed in learning and evolutionary robotics experiments.
        This paper also proposes an xml-inspired structure for the generated
        datasets that are used to store the perceptual information of the robots
        over the course of the simulations. These datasets may be used in
        learning experiments to estimate the quality of a candidate solution or
        for measuring its novelty."

        indicate the presence of HAZMAT, and this must be turned rapidly into a
        warning to ensure the safety of personnel in the vicinity. This
        currently requires either a static network of pre-deployed sensors,
        which can be costly and necessitates substantial planning, or the manual
        collection of sensor measurements, e.g., using handheld devices and
        HAZMAT suits, which can be time-consuming and places personnel at risk.

      abstract: In this paper we tackle the problem of finding the source of
        particulate matter with a mobile robot equipped with a low-cost
        multi-channel optical particle counting sensor. The proposed method is
        based on the Infotaxis odor source localization algorithm and makes
        multiple modifications to adapt it to particle plumes. In particular, we
        propose three simple but efficient ways to fuse multiple probability
        maps associated with various particle sizes and use the resulted
        integrated map to guide the robot’s movements. A refined measurement
        data collection is conducted in a wind tunnel to fit the particle plume
        model. The method with three proposed integration strategies is
        evaluated in simulation and in the wind tunnel emulating realistic
        environmental conditions in a repeatable fashion. In particular, we have
        investigated the impact of two environmental parameters - the wind speed
        and source release rate on the algorithm performance. The proposed
        algorithm with the weighted multi-modality map integration strategy
        outperforms the original Infotaxis and the other two variants. In high
        wind speed, the proposed algorithm is able on average to estimate the
        source location with less than 1 meter error in
        the    $80~{m}^{2}$    wind tunnel arena.

        Sensors Journal},abstract={In this paper we tackle the problem of
        finding the source of particulate matter with a mobile robot equipped
        with a low-cost multi-channel optical particle counting sensor. The
        proposed method is based on the Infotaxis odor source localization
        algorithm and makes multiple modifications to adapt it to particle
        plumes. In particular, we propose three simple but efficient ways to
        fuse multiple probability maps associated with various particle sizes
        and use the resulted integrated map to guide the robot’s movements. A
        refined measurement data collection is conducted in a wind tunnel to fit
        the particle plume model. The method with three proposed integration
        strategies is evaluated in simulation and in the wind tunnel emulating
        realistic environmental conditions in a repeatable fashion. In
        particular, we have investigated the impact of two environmental
        parameters - the wind speed and source release rate on the algorithm
        performance. The proposed algorithm with the weighted multi-modality map
        integration strategy outperforms the original Infotaxis and the other
        two variants. In high wind speed, the proposed algorithm is able on
        average to estimate the source location with less than 1 meter error in
        the    $80~{m}^{2}$    wind tunnel arena.}}

      abstract: "Low-cost light scattering particulate matter (PM) sensors have been

        questioned, thus impeding their wide adoption in practice. To evaluate
        the accuracy of low-cost PM sensors in the field, a multi-sensor
        platform has been developed and co-located with BAM in Dongjak-gu,
        Seoul, Korea from 15 January 2019 to 4 September 2019. In this paper, a
        sample variation of low-cost sensors has been analyzed while using three

        conditions, such as humidity, temperature, and ambient light, have also

        calibration algorithm, which selectively applies multiple calibration
        models and statistically reduces residuals, while using a prebuilt
        parameter lookup table where each cell records statistical parameters of
        each calibration model at current input parameters. As our proposed

      abstract: Abstract Metal Oxide (MOX) semiconductor gas sensors have been widely
        used in monitoring targeted gases that are present in the environment.
        This type of gas sensor can also be utilized as a safety device to
        detect the source of gas leakage. Their uses in many applications are
        due to being user-friendly, lower in cost, high sensitivity and
        relatively quick response time. However, there are several factors that
        could affect their performance. This work investigates the effects of
        the changes in ambient temperature and humidity on the readings of these
        sensors at various gas concentration levels. A PCB board was developed,
        which consists of temperature and humidity sensors, as well as eight
        different MOX gas sensors (TGS2600, TCS2602, CCS803, MiCS552, GM-402B,
        GM-502B, GM-702B and MiCS6814). The board was subjected to various
        temperatures (16˚C to 30˚C) and humidity levels (45% to 75%). At each of
        these parameter settings, the gas sensor responses were recorded at
        different ethanol gas concentrations. The results of the study showed
        that the temperature and humidity affected all the gas sensor response.
        The magnitude of the sensors responses was observed to decrease with
        rising temperature and humidity levels, except for MICS6814 (NH3 sensor)
        which responses in the opposite manner. Hence, there is the need to take
        into consideration of the drift of gas sensors’ responses when there are
        changes in temperature and humidity.

      abstract: Mining is one of the main activities in Andean Countries and
        occupational safety is one of the most important duties. Despite this,
        there has been an increase in the number of accidents, even the
        mortality rate is still high. Therefore, a Terrestrial Mobile Robot
        called "MineBot", integrated with Teleoperation Open-Source
        technologies, has been proposed for exploring and detecting chemical and
        physical as well as biological agents within the underground mines for
        the purpose of keeping safe the place for workers. Endowed with both a
        strong Mechanical design and an intuitive Telerobotic system applying
        User Experience design principles as well as Navigation Control, and
        Environmental Monitoring systems along with an Internet of Things (IoT)
        Platform storage. It was developed in the Mechatronics Laboratory at
        Ricardo Palma University from 2016 to 2019. Finally, in order to assess
        the performance of the mechatronic system, two tests were carried out in
        Lima-Peru, at Mine Analogue Sites located in "Loma Amarilla" (Yellow
        Hill) and "Las Leyendas Park". In conclusion, positive results were
        achieved by taking into account the properties of moving on rugged
        surfaces as well as measuring environmental parameters.

      abstract: Global-Positioning-System Real-Time-Kinematics (GPS-RTK) is a highly
        accurate positioning technology which has become reasonably affordable
        in the recent past and which is very useful as a mobile robot
        localization method. However, much of the system-level inter-workings of
        a GPS-RTK system are likely not well understood by many roboticists and
        researchers. Our paper proposes a self-sufficient GPS-RTK system which
        is intended to be easily understood and readily deployable in a
        multitude of lab robotics scenarios. In order to further the
        understanding of GPS-RTK from a systems level, this paper first
        describes a Longe-Range Radio (LoRa®) GPS-RTK implementation from the
        ground up, as a synthesis of multiple open source technologies and
        independent projects, and then offers validation data of the system.

      abstract: The safety of the gas transmission infrastructure is one of the main
        concerns for infrastructure operating companies. Common gas pipelines’
        tightness control is tedious and time-consuming. The development of new
        methods is highly desirable. This paper focuses on the applications of
        air-borne methods for inspections of the natural gas pipelines. The main
        goal of this study is to test an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), equipped
        with a remote sensing methane detector, for natural gas leak detection
        from the pipeline network. Many studies of the use of the UAV with laser
        detectors have been presented in the literature. These studies include
        experiments mainly on the artificial methane sources simulating gas
        leaks. This study concerns the experiments on a real leakage of natural
        gas from a pipeline. The vehicle at first monitored the artificial
        source of methane to determine conditions for further experiments. Then
        the experiments on the selected section of the natural gas pipelines
        were conducted. The measurement data, along with spatial coordinates,
        were collected and analyzed using machine learning methods. The analysis
        enabled the identification of groups of spatially correlated regions
        which have increased methane concentrations. Investigations on the
        flight altitude influence on the accuracy of measurements were also
        carried out. A range of between 4 m and 15 m was depicted as optimal for
        data collection in the natural gas pipeline inspections. However, the
        results from the field experiments showed that areas with increased
        methane concentrations are significantly more difficult to identify,
        though they are still noticeable. The experiments also indicate that the
        lower altitudes of the UAV flights should be chosen. The results showed
        that UAV monitoring can be used as a tool for the preliminary selection
        of potentially untight gas pipeline sections.

        the applications of air-borne methods for inspections of the natural gas
        pipelines. The main goal of this study is to test an unmanned aerial
        vehicle (UAV), equipped with a remote sensing methane detector, for
        natural gas leak detection from the pipeline network. Many studies of
        the use of the UAV with laser detectors have been presented in the
        literature. These studies include experiments mainly on the artificial
        methane sources simulating gas leaks. This study concerns the
        experiments on a real leakage of natural gas from a pipeline. The
        vehicle at first monitored the artificial source of methane to determine
        conditions for further experiments. Then the experiments on the selected
        section of the natural gas pipelines were conducted. The measurement
        data, along with spatial coordinates, were collected and analyzed using
        machine learning methods. The analysis enabled the identification of
        groups of spatially correlated regions which have increased methane
        concentrations. Investigations on the flight altitude influence on the
        accuracy of measurements were also carried out. A range of between 4 m
        and 15 m was depicted as optimal for data collection in the natural gas
        pipeline inspections. However, the results from the field experiments
        showed that areas with increased methane concentrations are
        significantly more difficult to identify, though they are still
        noticeable. The experiments also indicate that the lower altitudes of
        the UAV flights should be chosen. The results showed that UAV monitoring
        can be used as a tool for the preliminary selection of potentially
        untight gas pipeline sections.}}

      abstract: Mobile robotic gas distribution mapping (GDM) is a useful tool for
        hazardous scene assessment where a quick and accurate representation of
        gas concentration levels is required throughout a staging area. However,
        research in robotic path planning for GDM has primarily focused on
        mapping in open spaces or estimating the source term in dispersion
        models. Whilst this may be appropriate for environment monitoring in
        general, the vast majority of GDM applications involve obstacles, and
        path planning for autonomous robots must account for this. This paper
        aims to tackle this challenge by integrating a GDM function with an
        informative path planning framework. Several GDM methods are explored
        for their suitability in cluttered environments and the GMRF method is
        chosen due to its ability to account for obstacle interactions within
        the plume. Based on the outputs of the GMRF, several reward functions
        are proposed for the informative path planner. These functions are
        compared to a lawnmower sweep in a high fidelity simulation, where the
        RMSE of the modelled gas distribution is recorded over time. It is found
        that informing the robot with uncertainty, normalised concentration and
        time cost, significantly reduces the time required for a single robot to
        achieve an accurate map in a large-scale, urban environment. In the
        context of a hazardous gas release scenario, this time reduction could
        save lives as well as further gas ingress.

        recognized the maximum value of odorant concentration during an over
        360° yaw turn and localized the odor source using the spiral-surge

      abstract: In hazardous gas leakage accidents in chemical clusters, quickly and

        can effectively speed up emergency response. While state-of-the-art
        researches designed kinds of autonomous sensing and searching
        techniques, e.g. cognitive-based strategies to complete the localization
        of the leakage source; the current studies cannot meet chemical
        cluster’s requirements with complex road network constraints and spatial
        scales. To address this problem, we firstly combine a cognitive search
        strategy with great theoretical performance (Entrotaxis algorithm) with
        an intermittent search strategy and propose a fresh searching algorithm,
        namely Entrotaxis-Turn (ET). The hybrid algorithm can make use of the
        triggered turn motion to bypass obstacles to avoid falling into a loop,
        thereby improving the success rate and saving the searching time.
        Secondly, we extend the ET algorithm to the multi-robot collaboration
        pattern (Multi-ET algorithm), in which each mobile sensor shares the
        information collected along its route with each other. To reveal the
        performance of the proposed algorithms, a simulation scene is built in a
        typical chemical cluster scene and diffused gas is generated based on
        the advection-diffusion equation. Through Monte Carlo simulations, the
        optimal parameter combinations in the ET and Multi-ET algorithm are

      abstract: Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are sources of greenhouse gases,
        hazardous air pollutants and offensive odors. These emissions can have
        negative repercussions in and around the plant, degrading the quality of
        life of surrounding neighborhoods, damaging the environment, and
        reducing employee’s overall job satisfaction. Current monitoring
        methodologies based on fixed gas detectors and sporadic olfactometric
        measurements (human panels) do not allow for an accurate spatial
        representation of such emissions. In this paper we use a small drone
        equipped with an array of electrochemical and metal oxide (MOX) sensors
        for mapping odorous gases in a mid-sized WWTP. An innovative sampling
        system based on two (10 m long) flexible tubes hanging from the drone
        allowed near-source sampling from a safe distance with negligible
        influence from the downwash of the drone’s propellers. The proposed
        platform is very convenient for monitoring hard-to-reach emission
        sources, such as the plant’s deodorization chimney, which turned out to
        be responsible for the strongest odor emissions. The geo-localized
        measurements visualized in the form of a two-dimensional (2D) gas
        concentration map revealed the main emission hotspots where abatement
        solutions were needed. A principal component analysis (PCA) of the
        multivariate sensor signals suggests that the proposed system can also
        be used to trace which emission source is responsible for a certain
        measurement.

        platform is very convenient for monitoring hard-to-reach emission
        sources, such as the plant’s deodorization chimney, which turned out to
        be responsible for the strongest odor emissions. The geo-localized
        measurements visualized in the form of a two-dimensional (2D) gas
        concentration map revealed the main emission hotspots where abatement
        solutions were needed. A principal component analysis (PCA) of the
        multivariate sensor signals suggests that the proposed system can also
        be used to trace which emission source is responsible for a certain
        measurement.}}

        tunnel collapse, toxic gases, the application of autonomous robots can
        improve the stability of exploration and efficiently perform repetitive
        exploratory operations. In this study, we developed a small autonomous
        driving robot for unmanned environmental monitoring in underground
        mines. The developed autonomous driving robot controls the steering
        according to the distance to the tunnel wall measured using the light

        performance of the developed robot at an amethyst mine in Korea, the
        robot was found to be able to autonomously drive through tunnel sections
        with ∼28 m length, ∼2.5 m height, and∼3 m width successfully. The
        average error of location estimation was approximately 0.16 m. Using
        environmental monitoring sensors, temperature of 15–17◦C, humidity of
        42%–43%, oxygen concentration of 15.6%–15.7%, and particle concentration
        of 0.008–0.38 mg/m3 were measured in the experimental area, and no

      abstract: Nano quadcopters are ideal for gas source localization (GSL) as they
        are safe, agile and inexpensive. However, their extremely restricted
        sensors and computational resources make GSL a daunting challenge. In
        this work, we propose a novel bug algorithm named `Sniffy Bug', which
        allows a fully autonomous swarm of gas-seeking nano quadcopters to
        localize a gas source in an unknown, cluttered and GPS-denied
        environments. The computationally efficient, mapless algorithm foresees
        in the avoidance of obstacles and other swarm members, while pursuing
        desired waypoints. The waypoints are first set for exploration, and,
        when a single swarm member has sensed the gas, by a particle swarm
        optimization-based procedure. We evolve all the parameters of the bug
        (and PSO) algorithm, using our novel simulation pipeline, `AutoGDM'. It
        builds on and expands open source tools in order to enable fully
        automated end-to-end environment generation and gas dispersion modeling,
        allowing for learning in simulation. Flight tests show that Sniffy Bug
        with evolved parameters outperforms manually selected parameters in
        cluttered, real-world environments.

      abstract: This paper proposes an optimal autonomous search framework, namely
        Dual Control for Exploration and Exploitation (DCEE), for a target at
        unknown location in an unknown environment. Source localisation is to
        find sources of atmospheric hazardous material release in a partially
        unknown environment. This paper proposes a control theoretic approach to
        this autonomous search problem. To cope with an unknown target location,
        at each step, the target location is estimated by Bayesian inference.
        Then a control action is taken to minimise the error between future
        robot position and the hypothesised future estimation of the target
        location. The latter is generated by hypothesised measurements at the
        corresponding future robot positions (due to the control action) with
        the current estimation of the target location as a prior. It shows that
        this approach can take into account both the error between the next
        robot position and the estimate of the target location, and the
        uncertainty of the estimate. This approach is further extended to the
        case with not only an unknown source location, but also an unknown local
        environment (e.g. wind speed and direction). Different from current
        information theoretic approaches, this new control theoretic approach
        achieves the optimal trade-off between exploitation and exploration in a
        unknown environment with an unknown target by driving the robot moving
        towards estimated target location while reducing its estimation
        uncertainty. This scheme is implemented using particle filtering on a
        mobile robot. Simulation and experimental studies demonstrate promising
        performance of the proposed approach. The relationships between the
        proposed approach, informative path planning, dual control, and classic
        model predictive control are discussed and compared.

        source localisation using autonomous systems, most previous works have

        obstacle avoidance in a holistic framework. The proposed system
        intelligently produces potential gas sampling locations based on the
        current estimation of the wind field and the local map. Then a tree
        search is performed to generate paths toward the estimated source
        location that traverse around any obstacles and still allow for
        exploration of potentially superior sampling locations. The proposed
        informed tree planning algorithm is then tested against the Entrotaxis
        technique in a series of high fidelity simulations. The proposed system
        is found to reduce source position error far more efficiently than
        Entrotaxis in a feature rich environment, whilst also exhibiting vastly
        more consistent and robust results.

      abstract: In situations where toxic or dangerous airborne material is leaking,
        mobile robots equipped with gas sensors are a safe alternative to human
        reconnaissance. This work presents the Domain Knowledge Assisted Robotic
        Exploration and Source Localization (DARES) approach. It allows a
        multi-robot system to localize multiple sources or leaks autonomously
        and independently of a human operator. The probabilistic approach builds
        upon domain knowledge in the form of a physical model of gas dispersion
        and the a priori assumption that the dispersion process is driven by
        multiple but sparsely distributed sources. A formal criterion is used to

      abstract: Owing to the specific characteristics of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
        (UAVs), the demands and applications increase dramatically for them
        being deployed in confined or closed space for surveying, inspection or
        detection to substitute human. However, Global Positioning System (GPS)
        may lose effectiveness or become unavailable due to the potential signal
        block or interference in that operational environment. Under such
        circumstances, an imperative requirement on new positioning technology
        for UAV has emerged. With the rapid development of Radio Frequency (RF)
        based localisation technologies, leveraging small wireless sensor nodes
        for low-cost, low latency, low energy consumption and accurate
        localisation on UAV has received significant attention. However, no
        up-to-date review has been conducted in this area so far. Therefore,
        this paper aims to give a comprehensive survey on the RF based
        localisation systems with different radio communication technologies and
        localisation mechanisms on UAV positioning. Toward this end, an
        exhaustive evaluation framework is first established to evaluate the
        performance of each system on UAV positioning from different
        perspectives. Particularly, the Ultra-wideband (UWB) based system with
        time-based mechanisms is highlighted for UAV positioning under the

      abstract: Summary   Quantification of odor emissions in wastewater treatment
        plants (WWTPs) is key to minimize odor impact to surrounding

        nose specially designed for real-time odor monitoring in WWTPs using
        small drones. The so-called RHINOS e-nose allows odor measurements with
        high spatial resolution, and its accuracy is only slightly worse than
        that of dynamic olfactometry. The device has been calibrated using odor
        samples collected in a WWTP in Spain over a period of six months and
        validated in the same WWTP three weeks after calibration. The promising
        results obtained support the suitability of the proposed instrument to
        identify the odor sources having the highest emissions, which may give a

      abstract: "NPL has carried out a market review of sensors for B-Hive Innovations
        Ltd. in order to provide a summary of available measurement technologies
        for measuring PPM and PPB levels of ethanol, ethene (ethylene),
        methylhydrazine and methanethiol (methyl mercaptan) in ambient air
        within potato storage facilities. During natural aging and storage,
        potatoes emit small quantities of VOCs, but when these potatoes start to
        decay or suffer from disease the emissions rates can increase. These
        four components have been shown to be key biomarkers for blackheart - an
        important internal defect which is extremely hard to early detect.
        B-Hive is looking for a sensing system (preferably low cost) to measure
        these four biomarkers along with carbon dioxide, relative humidity and
        temperature, preferably to provide a suitable output for decision-making
        tools. Research journals have not been included in this review as is
        understood that the customer is interested in products currently in the
        marketplace and not products that would require significant development.
        Photo Ionisation Detectors (PIDs) theoretically have the capability to
        measure the four primary compounds of interest in a cold and humid
        atmosphere (1.5-6°C, 80-95% relative humidity) found in potato storage
        facilities. The use of a 9.8 eV lamp PID and a 10.6 eV lamp PID would
        help in distinguishing methylhydrazine and methanethiol mixtures as
        ethanol and ethene would not be detected by the 9.8 eV PID whilst the
        10.6 eV PID would detect all 4 components. Correction factors would need
        to be applied before subtracting the 9.8 eV result from the 10.6 eV
        result, as the correction factors for the two C2 components for the 10.6
        eV PID are much larger than for the other 2 components of interest. It
        may be better to use a system with 9.8 eV / 11.7 eV lamps as the ethene
        and ethanol will only just be ionised by a 10.6eV lamp and hence be
        relatively insensitive to changes in these concentrations. Any PID
        sensing system should be protected from the possibility of condensation
        forming in the optical path as this will interfere with the measurement.
        Condensation can be prevented by drying the sample before it reaches the
        PID or by warming the PID sensor itself. Electrochemical cells
        theoretically have the capability to measure ethene, methylhydrazine and
        methanethiol, but no electrochemical cells were found that could measure
        ethanol. The cold and humid atmosphere should not pose problems for the
        cells, because they are specified to operate under these conditions. The
        output of electrochemical sensors can depend strongly on the cell’s
        temperature and therefore good temperature control / compensation is
        required. Any heating of electrochemical sensors to reduce the chances
        of condensation should be well controlled to reduce the risk of
        overheating and drying out the cell electrolyte. As the changes in the
        expected ethanol, ethene, methylhydrazine and methanethiol
        concentrations are likely to be small and slow then extended sampling
        and averaging is likely to be required as the precision of both PIDs and
        electrochemical cells are likely to be similar to these changes.
        Averaging for many hours may increase the signal to noise ratio to an
        acceptable level and allow these small changes to be detected. This
        should not be an issue as only a few results per day are required. All
        sampling systems and sensors should be protected from contamination
        during the application of the mint oil as this is likely to contaminate
        the sensors and any sampling system. It may be advisable to maintain
        this contamination protection for 12 to 24 hours after each mint oil
        application. Optical methods for the low cost sensing of carbon dioxide
        concentrations are well developed and commercialised. Metal oxide
        sensors are able to measure VOCs in ambient air but can have low
        selectivity to individual hydrocarbons and can suffer from significant
        cross interferences from water vapour. These limitations can be overcome
        if the measurement atmosphere is generally stable in composition and
        also stable in temperature and relative humidity. As potato cold stores
        can be left sealed for up to a few months at constant temperature and
        relative humidity these cross interferences are likely to be
        accommodated, making metal oxide sensors a suitable candidate. Another
        advantage is that the gas concentrations are likely to be changing
        slowly so that any change in gas composition or concentration will be
        detected. Nanometre scale sensing devices are starting to show promising
        performance for the detection of decay in foodstuffs in scientific
        literature and promotional press articles. It is recommended that these
        be considered in the future when the sensors are closer to market. As
        with all sensor systems, the effect of cross interference from other
        gases likely to be present in the ambient atmosphere and the effect of
        temperature and relative humidity influences need to be robustly tested
        during pre‑validation before use. Higher cost sensing systems for the
        four principal components of interest are also discussed and include:
        Photo Acoustic Spectroscopy Cavity Ring-down Spectroscopy Gas

      abstract: In the gas source search and localisation problem, the use of

        speed and lack of human interaction with hazardous materials. This
        letter presents an aerial robotic platform for performing source term
        estimation of an unknown chemical release in a challenging a-priori
        unknown and GPS-denied environment. The proposed system forms the search
        strategy using the state-of-the-art control concept, dual control for
        exploitation and exploration, and realises such a function in the
        aforementioned challenging scenario using an RRT* based path planner. A
        novel downsampling process on the RRT* is also proposed that addresses
        the computational infeasibility of calculating the utility of a large
        number of sample states, whilst still maintaining sample state
        diversity. The proposed algorithm is tested in a high fidelity
        simulation environment under a number of configurations, and compared
        against competing algorithms. The system architecture is also brought
        forward into a bespoke UAV platform and experimentally tested in
        real-world conditions. The proposed system is shown to be capable of
        performing source term estimation robustly and efficiently, which
        provides a step forward in showing the real world application of
        previously academic functions.

        against competing algorithms. The system architecture is also brought
        forward into a bespoke UAV platform and experimentally tested in
        real-world conditions. The proposed system is shown to be capable of
        performing source term estimation robustly and efficiently, which
        provides a step forward in showing the real world application of

      abstract: The use of robotics olfaction for gas source localization or mapping
        has become a concern given the issues of terrorism or industrial
        accidents that may cause damage to the environment. A typical scenario
        is to send a robot to a place where a dangerous gas leak has just
        occurred. The robot’s task is to map gas concentrations in the region of
        interest as effectively as possible. This paper addresses how the robot
        performs gas exploration in a large and unknown environment. One of the
        issues that needs to be addressed is the fact that the computation time
        of the path planning, frontier detection, goal decision making and gas
        distribution mapping is slower if all cells in the occupancy grid map
        are involved in a large environment. Consequently, the Rapidly-exploring
        Random Tree (RRT) algorithm is chosen as the main algorithm. The RRT
        graph guides the robot’s navigation, utilizes the vertices as goal
        candidates, gas mean and variance value, and searches for a new
        frontier. A new strategy is proposed to address the frontier exploration
        and gas exploitation trade-off. Finally, a Robot Operating System (ROS),
        Gazebo, and a 3D gas simulator are used to compare the proposed strategy
        performance with the others in a large outdoor environment.

      abstract: Chemical gas dispersion can represent a severe threat to human and
        animal lives, as well as to the environment. Constructing a map of the
        distribution of gas in a fast and reliable manner is critical to ensure
        accurate monitoring of at-risk facilities and to coordinate targeted and
        swift rescue missions when an emergency occurs. In recent years, robots
        have been endowed with gas sensing capabilities, and several algorithms
        to generate gas maps have been studied, often producing a 2D map. Two of
        the major drawbacks of these studies are concerned with the fact that
        the robot's path is often fixed to a predefined route, and that the
        tridimensionality of the gas dispersion phenomenon is not captured by
        the final gas maps. In this paper, we study the effect of the
        application of a random walk and of an adaptive path planning approach
        based on informative quantities to gas mapping in a 3D environment using
        a micro aerial vehicle with severe flight time constraints. We also
        introduce a clustering strategy to enhance the exploration of the
        environment. The strategies are compared to a lawnmower movement and
        evaluated against a ground truth map of the environment, both in
        simulation and with physical experiments, in order to assess which ones
        are able to provide an accurate gas map, while simultaneously achieving
        satisfactory coverage of the desired volume under time constraints.

      abstract: The issue of air pollution and the monitoring of air quality is a very
        serious problem in today's society. This problem is basically caused by
        human in activities related to industry, construction, transport, etc.
        High pollution values have become an important risk factor for the
        health of citizens. Measuring pollution for air quality control is not
        an easy task, as it requires highly specialized equipment, working under
        special conditions, which makes reference systems bulky and costly
        installations. To this must be added the disadvantages of measuring in
        areas with little or no accessibility. The aim of this work is to
        develop an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with low-cost sensors
        to monitor air quality both on the move and stationary in a position
        that is difficult to access. It is equipped with sensors for carbon
        monoxide (CO), ozone (O 3 ), nitrogen monoxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide
        (NO 2 ) measurement. The electronic instrumentation has been developed
        in the laboratory for this application and it is optimized to minimize
        interference between the different devices. It also incorporates a
        pneumatic pump and a tube for air sampling outside the influence of the
        propellers. In this study, a series of measurements of the UAV were
        carried out at a stationary location next to a reference station in
        order to perform the calibration of the sensors. Once calibrated, a
        series of measurements have been made in motion. The experimental
        results show the accuracy of the measurements of the proposed prototype
        as well as its robustness in-flight measurements. • A small size, low
        noise and high accuracy electronic system for air quality monitoring
        have been developed. • A sampling system have been designed for avoiding
        interference of motors and downwash. • They have been integrated in an
        Unmanned Air Vehicle. • A field calibration has been done by using a
        certified reference equipment. • Measurements in static and in movement
        have been done, analyzing the responses of sensors and the influence of
        ambient and flight parameters. • Good results have been obtained in
        static mode in comparison with the reference methods and in flight mode.

      abstract: Understanding atmospheric transport and dispersal events has an
        important role in a range of scenarios. Of particular importance is
        aiding in emergency response after an intentional or accidental
        chemical, biological or radiological (CBR) release. In the event of a
        CBR release, it is desirable to know the current and future spatial
        extent of the contaminant as well as its location in order to aid
        decision makers in emergency response. Many dispersion phenomena may be
        opaque or clear, thus monitoring them using visual methods will be
        difficult or impossible. In these scenarios, relevant concentration
        sensors are required to detect the substance where they can form a
        static network on the ground or be placed upon mobile platforms. This
        paper presents a review of techniques used to gain information about
        atmospheric dispersion events using static or mobile sensors. The review

      abstract: "Abstract   Infrared laser-absorption spectroscopy (IR-LAS) sensors
        play an important role in diagnosing and characterizing a wide range of
        combustion systems. Of all the laser-diagnostic techniques, LAS is
        arguably the most versatile and quantitative, as it has been used
        extensively to provide quantitative, species-specific measurements of
        gas temperature, pressure, composition and velocity in both laboratory-
        and industrial-scale systems. Historically, most IR-LAS work has been
        conducted using tunable diode lasers; however, today’s researchers have
        access to a wide range of light sources that provide unique sensing
        capabilities and convenient access to nearly the entire IR spectrum (≈
        0.8 to 16µm). In particular, the advent of room-temperature
        wavelength-tunable mid-infrared semiconductor lasers (e.g., interband-
        and quantum-cascade lasers) and hyperspectral light sources (e.g., MEMS
        VCSELs, Fourier-domain mode-locked lasers, dispersed supercontinuum, and
        frequency combs) has provided a number of unique capabilities that
        combustion researchers have exploited. The primary goals of this review
        paper are: (1) to document the recent development, application, and
        current capabilities of IR-LAS sensors for laboratory- and
        industrial-scale combustors and propulsion systems, (2) to elucidate the
        design and use of IR-LAS sensors for combustion gases through a
        discussion of the modern sensor-design process and state-of-the-art
        techniques, and (3) to highlight some of the remaining measurement
        opportunities, challenges, and needs. A thorough review and description
        of the fundamental spectroscopy governing the accuracy of such sensors,
        and recent findings and databases that enable improved modeling of
        molecular absorption spectra will also be provided."

        diagnosing and characterizing a wide range of combustion systems. Of all
        the laser-diagnostic techniques, LAS is arguably the most versatile and
        quantitative, as it has been used extensively to provide quantitative,
        species-specific measurements of gas temperature, pressure, composition
        and velocity in both laboratory- and industrial-scale systems.
        Historically, most IR-LAS work has been conducted using tunable diode
        lasers; however, today’s researchers have access to a wide range of
        light sources that provide unique sensing capabilities and convenient
        access to nearly the entire IR spectrum (≈ 0.8 to 16µm). In particular,
        the advent of room-temperature wavelength-tunable mid-infrared
        semiconductor lasers (e.g., interband- and quantum-cascade lasers) and
        hyperspectral light sources (e.g., MEMS VCSELs, Fourier-domain
        mode-locked lasers, dispersed supercontinuum, and frequency combs) has
        provided a number of unique capabilities that combustion researchers
        have exploited. The primary goals of this review paper are: (1) to
        document the recent development, application, and current capabilities
        of IR-LAS sensors for laboratory- and industrial-scale combustors and
        propulsion systems, (2) to elucidate the design and use of IR-LAS
        sensors for combustion gases through a discussion of the modern
        sensor-design process and state-of-the-art techniques, and (3) to
        highlight some of the remaining measurement opportunities, challenges,
        and needs. A thorough review and description of the fundamental
        spectroscopy governing the accuracy of such sensors, and recent findings
        and databases that enable improved modeling of molecular absorption
        spectra will also be provided.}}

      abstract: Odor source localization with mobile robots has recently been subject
        to many research works, but remains a challenging task mainly due to the
        large number of environmental parameters that make it hard to describe
        gas concentration fields. We designed a new algorithm called Adaptive
        Levy Taxis (ALT) to achieve odor plume tracking through a correlated
        random walk. In order to compare its performances with well-established
        solutions, we have implemented three moth-inspired algorithms on the
        same robotic platform. To improve the performance of the latter
        algorithms, we developed a rigorous way to determine one of their key
        parameters, the odor concentration threshold at which the robot
        considers to be inside or outside the plume. The methods have been
        systematically evaluated in a large wind tunnel under various
        environmental conditions. Experiments revealed that the performance of
        ALT is consistently good in all environmental conditions (in particular
        when compared to the three reference algorithms) in terms of both
        distance traveled to find the source and success rate.

      abstract: This paper introduces the design, calibration, and validation of a
        low-cost portable sensor for the real-time measurement of dust particles
        within the environment. The proposed design consists of low hardware
        cost and calibration based on temperature and humidity sensing to
        achieve accurate processing of airborne dust density. Using commercial
        particulate matter sensors, a highly accurate air quality monitoring
        sensor was designed and calibrated using real world variations in
        humidity and temperature for indoor and outdoor applications.
        Furthermore, to provide a low-cost secure solution for real-time data
        transfer and monitoring, an onboard Bluetooth module with AES data
        encryption protocol was implemented. The wireless sensor was tested
        against a Dylos DC1100 Pro Air Quality Monitor, as well as an Alphasense
        OPC-N2 optical air quality monitoring sensor for accuracy. The sensor
        was also tested for reliability by comparing the sensor to an exact copy
        of itself under indoor and outdoor conditions. It was found that
        accurate measurements under real-world humid and temperature varying and
        dynamically changing conditions were achievable using the proposed
        sensor when compared to the commercially available sensors. In addition
        to accurate and reliable sensing, this sensor was designed to be
        wearable and perform real-time data collection and transmission, making
        it easy to collect and analyze data for air quality monitoring and
        real-time feedback in remote health monitoring applications. Thus, the

      abstract: Metal-oxide gas sensors are largely used in electronic nose devices
        thanks to their high sensitivity and low cost. But for a reliable
        utilization of these sensors it is imperative to deal with their
        sensitive element alteration which is produced by gas exposures. In
        order to limit significantly this alteration, a very time-consuming
        cleaning process is necessary after each gas exposure. In this way, when
        continuous and rapid monitoring of a gas concentration is desired, the
        slow recovery process (tens of minutes) limits strongly the use of an
        electronic nose composed of MOX sensors. We present here, a signal
        processing method to reduce the impact of the gas sensor response
        instabilities resulted from an incomplete cleaning process of their
        sensitive layer. The proposed technique is based on the correction of
        sensor responses instabilities, called short-term drifts, by taking into
        account information coming from the state of the sensor regeneration.
        This new approach is explored using experimental data from a gas sensor
        array responding to various concentrations of pine essential oil vapors.
        The proposed signal processing technique significantly limits the
        short-term drift effects on the gas sensor responses. Comparing to
        classical methods used for drift correction, our approach shows an
        improved intensity discrimination of the odorant atmospheres. We hope
        that this study can help industrials or researchers working on the field

      abstract: Abstract Individual behavior, in biology, economics, and computer
        science, is often described in terms of balancing exploration and
        exploitation. Foraging has been a canonical setting for studying reward
        seeking and information gathering, from bacteria to humans, mostly
        focusing on individual behavior. Inspired by the gradient-climbing
        nature of chemotaxis, the infotaxis algorithm showed that locally
        maximizing the expected information gain leads to efficient and
        ethological individual foraging. In nature, as well as in theoretical
        settings, conspecifics can be a valuable source of information about the
        environment. Whereas the nature and role of interactions between animals
        have been studied extensively, the design principles of information
        processing in such groups are mostly unknown. We present an algorithm
        for group foraging, which we term “socialtaxis,” that unifies infotaxis
        and social interactions, where each individual in the group
        simultaneously maximizes its own sensory information and a social
        information term. Surprisingly, we show that when individuals aim to
        increase their information diversity, efficient collective behavior
        emerges in groups of opportunistic agents, which is comparable to the
        optimal group behavior. Importantly, we show the high efficiency of
        biologically plausible socialtaxis settings, where agents share little
        or no information and rely on simple computations to infer information
        from the behavior of their conspecifics. Moreover, socialtaxis does not
        require parameter tuning and is highly robust to sensory and behavioral
        noise. We use socialtaxis to predict distinct optimal couplings in
        groups of selfish vs. altruistic agents, reflecting how it can be
        naturally extended to study social dynamics and collective computation
        in general settings.

        Schneidman},doi={10.1073/pnas.1618055114},pmid={null},pmcid={null},mag_id={2616435561},journal={Proceedings
        of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of
        America},abstract={Abstract Individual behavior, in biology, economics,
        and computer science, is often described in terms of balancing
        exploration and exploitation. Foraging has been a canonical setting for
        studying reward seeking and information gathering, from bacteria to
        humans, mostly focusing on individual behavior. Inspired by the
        gradient-climbing nature of chemotaxis, the infotaxis algorithm showed
        that locally maximizing the expected information gain leads to efficient
        and ethological individual foraging. In nature, as well as in
        theoretical settings, conspecifics can be a valuable source of
        information about the environment. Whereas the nature and role of
        interactions between animals have been studied extensively, the design
        principles of information processing in such groups are mostly unknown.
        We present an algorithm for group foraging, which we term “socialtaxis,”
        that unifies infotaxis and social interactions, where each individual in
        the group simultaneously maximizes its own sensory information and a
        social information term. Surprisingly, we show that when individuals aim
        to increase their information diversity, efficient collective behavior
        emerges in groups of opportunistic agents, which is comparable to the
        optimal group behavior. Importantly, we show the high efficiency of
        biologically plausible socialtaxis settings, where agents share little
        or no information and rely on simple computations to infer information
        from the behavior of their conspecifics. Moreover, socialtaxis does not
        require parameter tuning and is highly robust to sensory and behavioral
        noise. We use socialtaxis to predict distinct optimal couplings in
        groups of selfish vs. altruistic agents, reflecting how it can be
        naturally extended to study social dynamics and collective computation
        in general settings.}}

      abstract: This work introduces a novel solution to approximate in real time the
        2D wind flow present in a geometrically known environment. It is
        grounded on the probabilistic framework provided by a Markov random
        field and enables the estimation of the most probable wind field from a
        set of noisy observations, for the case of incompressible and steady
        wind flow. Our method delivers reasonably precise results without
        falling into common unrealistic assumptions like homogeneous wind flow,
        absence of obstacles, etc., and performs very efficiently (less than 0.5
        seconds for an environment represented with a 100×100 cell grid). This
        approach is then quite suitable for applications that require real-time
        estimation of the wind flow, as for example, the localization of gas
        sources, prediction of the gas dispersion, or the mapping of the gas
        distribution of different chemicals released in a given scenario.

      abstract: The potential of inexpensive Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) gas
        sensors to be used for urban air quality monitoring has been the topic
        of increasing interest in the last decade. This paper discusses some of
        the lessons of three years of experience working with such sensors on a
        novel instrument platform (Small Open General purpose Sensor (SOGS)) in
        the measurement of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide and ozone
        concentrations. Analytic methods for increasing long-term accuracy of
        measurements are discussed, which permit nitrogen dioxide measurements
        with 95% confidence intervals of 20.0     μ g    m  − 3       and ozone
        precision of 26.8     μ g    m  − 3      , for measurements over a
        period one month away from calibration, averaged over 18 months of such
        calibrations. Beyond four months from calibration, sensor drift becomes
        significant, and accuracy is significantly reduced. Successful
        calibration schemes are discussed with the use of controlled artificial
        atmospheres complementing deployment on a reference weather station
        exposed to the elements. Manufacturing variation in the attributes of
        individual sensors are examined, an experiment possible due to the
        instrument being equipped with pairs of sensors of the same kind. Good
        repeatability (better than 0.7 correlation) between individual sensor
        elements is shown. The results from sensors that used fans to push air
        past an internal sensor element are compared with mounting the sensors
        on the outside of the enclosure, the latter design increasing effective
        integration time to more than a day. Finally, possible paths forward are
        suggested for improving the reliability of this promising sensor
        technology for measuring pollution in an urban environment.

        potential of inexpensive Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors to
        be used for urban air quality monitoring has been the topic of
        increasing interest in the last decade. This paper discusses some of the
        lessons of three years of experience working with such sensors on a
        novel instrument platform (Small Open General purpose Sensor (SOGS)) in
        the measurement of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide and ozone
        concentrations. Analytic methods for increasing long-term accuracy of
        measurements are discussed, which permit nitrogen dioxide measurements
        with 95% confidence intervals of 20.0     μ g    m  − 3       and ozone
        precision of 26.8     μ g    m  − 3      , for measurements over a
        period one month away from calibration, averaged over 18 months of such
        calibrations. Beyond four months from calibration, sensor drift becomes
        significant, and accuracy is significantly reduced. Successful
        calibration schemes are discussed with the use of controlled artificial
        atmospheres complementing deployment on a reference weather station
        exposed to the elements. Manufacturing variation in the attributes of
        individual sensors are examined, an experiment possible due to the
        instrument being equipped with pairs of sensors of the same kind. Good
        repeatability (better than 0.7 correlation) between individual sensor
        elements is shown. The results from sensors that used fans to push air
        past an internal sensor element are compared with mounting the sensors
        on the outside of the enclosure, the latter design increasing effective
        integration time to more than a day. Finally, possible paths forward are
        suggested for improving the reliability of this promising sensor
        technology for measuring pollution in an urban environment.}}

      abstract: Sensor networks have limited capabilities to model complex phenomena
        occuring between sensing nodes. Mobile robots can be used to close this
        gap and learn local interpolation models. In this paper, we utilize Echo
        State Networks in order to learn the calibration and interpolation model
        between sensor nodes using measurements collected by a mobile robot. The
        use of Echo State Networks allows to deal with temporal dependencies
        implicitly, while the spatial mapping with a Gaussian Process estimator
        exploits the fact that Echo State Networks learn linear combinations of
        complex temporal dynamics. The resulting Echo State Map elegantly
        combines spatial and temporal cues into a single representation. We
        showcase the method in the exposure modeling task of building dust
        distribution maps for foundries, a challenge which is of great interest
        to occupational health researchers. Results from simulated data and real
        world experiments highlight the potential of Echo State Maps. While we
        focus on particulate matter measurements, the method can be applied for
        any other environmental variables like temperature or gas concentration.

      abstract: Detection of leaks of fugitive greenhouse gases (GHGs) from landfills
        and natural gas infrastructure is critical for not only their safe
        operation but also for protecting the environment. Current inspection
        practices involve moving a methane detector within the target area by a
        person or vehicle. This procedure is dangerous, time consuming, labor
        intensive and above all unavailable when access to the desired area is
        limited. Remote sensing by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped
        with a methane detector is a cost-effective and fast method for methane
        detection and monitoring, especially for vast and remote areas. This
        paper describes the integration of an off-the-shelf laser-based methane
        detector into a multi-rotor UAV and demonstrates its efficacy in
        generating an aerial methane concentration map of a landfill. The UAV
        flies a preset flight path measuring methane concentrations in a
        vertical air column between the UAV and the ground surface. Measurements
        were taken at 10 Hz giving a typical distance between measurements of
        0.2 m when flying at 2 m/s. The UAV was set to fly at 25 to 30 m above
        the ground. We conclude that besides its utility in landfill monitoring,
        the proposed method is ready for other environmental applications as
        well as the inspection of natural gas infrastructure that can release
        methane with much higher concentrations.

        inherently a 3D phenomenon, most of the previous works have downgraded

        conditions in terms of wind speed, source release rates and odor
        threshold. Studying success rate and execution time, the results show
        that the proposed method outperforms its 2D counterpart and is robust to
        the various setup conditions, especially to the source release rate and
        the odor threshold.

      abstract: Abstract   There has been a strong interest in emergency planning in
        response to an attack or accidental release of harmful chemical,
        biological, radiological or nuclear substances. Under such
        circumstances, it is of paramount importance to determine the location
        and release rate of the hazardous source to forecast the future harm it
        may cause and employ methods to minimize the disturbance. In this paper,
        a sensor data collection strategy is proposed whereby an autonomous
        mobile sensor is guided to address such a problem with a high degree of
        accuracy and in a short amount of time. First, the parameters of the
        release source are estimated using the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling
        approach. The most informative manoeuvre from the set of possible
        choices is then selected using the concept of maximum entropy sampling.
        Numerical simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the
        proposed algorithm compared to traditional approaches in terms of
        estimation accuracy and the number of measurements required.

        radiological or nuclear substances. Under such circumstances, it is of
        paramount importance to determine the location and release rate of the
        hazardous source to forecast the future harm it may cause and employ
        methods to minimize the disturbance. In this paper, a sensor data
        collection strategy is proposed whereby an autonomous mobile sensor is
        guided to address such a problem with a high degree of accuracy and in a
        short amount of time. First, the parameters of the release source are
        estimated using the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling approach. The most
        informative manoeuvre from the set of possible choices is then selected
        using the concept of maximum entropy sampling. Numerical simulations
        demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared
        to traditional approaches in terms of estimation accuracy and the number
        of measurements required.}}

      abstract: This paper proposes a strategy for performing an efficient autonomous
        search to find an emitting source of sporadic cues of noisy information.
        We focus on the search for a source of unknown strength, releasing
        particles into the atmosphere where turbulence can cause irregular
        gradients and intermittent patches of sensory cues. Bayesian inference,
        implemented via the sequential Monte Carlo method, is used to update
        posterior probability distributions of the source location and strength
        in response to sensor measurements. Posterior sampling is then used to
        approximate a reward function, leading to the manoeuvre to where the
        entropy of the predictive distribution is the greatest. As it is
        developed based on the maximum entropy sampling principle, the proposed
        framework is termed as Entrotaxis. We compare the performance and search
        behaviour of Entrotaxis with the popular Infotaxis algorithm, for
        searching in sparse and turbulent conditions where typical
        gradient-based approaches become inefficient or fail. The algorithms are
        assessed via Monte Carlo simulations with simulated data and an
        experimental dataset. Whilst outperforming the Infotaxis algorithm in
        most of our simulated scenarios, by achieving a faster mean search time,
        the proposed strategy is also more computationally efficient during the
        decision making process.

      abstract: Employing automated robots for sampling gas distributions and for
        localizing gas sources is beneficial since it avoids hazards for a human
        operator. This paper addresses the problem of exploring a gas diffusion
        process using a multi-agent system consisting of several mobile sensing
        robots. The diffusion process is modeled using a partial differential
        equation (PDE). It is assumed that the diffusion process is driven by
        only a few spatial sources at unknown locations with unknown intensity.
        The goal of the multi-robot exploration is thus to identify source
        parameters, in particular, their number, locations and magnitudes.
        Therefore, this paper develops a probabilistic approach towards PDE
        identification under sparsity constraint using factor graphs and a
        message passing algorithm. Moreover, the message passing schemes permits
        efficient distributed implementation of the algorithm. This brings
        significant advantages with respect to scalability, computational
        complexity and robustness of the proposed exploration algorithm. Based
        on the derived probabilistic model, an exploration strategy to guide the
        mobile agents in real time to more informative sampling locations is
        proposed. Hardware- in-the-loop experiments with real mobile robots show
        that the proposed exploration approach accelerates the identification of
        the source parameters and outperforms systematic sampling.

        laboratory and under actual ambient field conditions, to investigate its

        response to increasing humidity and the presence of fog in the air. We

        significant increases in particle number and mass concentrations at

      abstract: "With the popularization and wide application of drones in military
        and civilian fields, the safety of drones must be considered. At
        present, the failure and drop rates of drones are still much higher than
        those of manned aircraft. Therefore, it is imperative to improve the
        research on the safe landing and recovery of drones. However, most drone
        navigation methods rely on global positioning system (GPS) signals. When
        GPS signals are missing, these drones cannot land or recover properly.
        In fact, with the help of optical equipment and image recognition
        technology, the position and posture of the drone in three dimensions
        can be obtained, and the environment where the drone is located can be
        perceived. This paper proposes and implements a monocular vision-based
        drone autonomous landing system in emergencies and in unstructured
        environments. In this system, a novel map representation approach is
        proposed that combines three-dimensional features and a mid-pass filter
        to remove noise and construct a grid map with different heights. In
        addition, a region segmentation is presented to detect the edges of
        different-height grid areas for the sake of improving the speed and
        accuracy of the subsequent landing area selection. As a visual landing
        technology, this paper evaluates the proposed algorithm in two tasks:
        scene reconstruction integrity and landing location security. In these
        tasks, firstly, a drone scans the scene and acquires key frames in the
        monocular visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system in
        order to estimate the pose of the drone and to create a
        three-dimensional point cloud map. Then, the filtered three-dimensional
        point cloud map is converted into a grid map. The grid map is further
        divided into different regions to select the appropriate landing zone.
        Thus, it can carry out autonomous route planning. Finally, when it stops
        upon the landing field, it will start the descent mode near the landing
        area. Experiments in multiple sets of real scenes show that the
        environmental awareness and the landing area selection have high
        robustness and real-time performance."

        the popularization and wide application of drones in military and
        civilian fields, the safety of drones must be considered. At present,
        the failure and drop rates of drones are still much higher than those of
        manned aircraft. Therefore, it is imperative to improve the research on
        the safe landing and recovery of drones. However, most drone navigation
        methods rely on global positioning system (GPS) signals. When GPS
        signals are missing, these drones cannot land or recover properly. In
        fact, with the help of optical equipment and image recognition
        technology, the position and posture of the drone in three dimensions
        can be obtained, and the environment where the drone is located can be
        perceived. This paper proposes and implements a monocular vision-based
        drone autonomous landing system in emergencies and in unstructured
        environments. In this system, a novel map representation approach is
        proposed that combines three-dimensional features and a mid-pass filter
        to remove noise and construct a grid map with different heights. In
        addition, a region segmentation is presented to detect the edges of
        different-height grid areas for the sake of improving the speed and
        accuracy of the subsequent landing area selection. As a visual landing

      abstract: Air pollution is a major concern for public health and urban
        environments. Conventional air pollution monitoring systems install a
        few highly accurate, expensive stations at representative locations.
        Their sparse coverage and low spatial resolution are insufficient to
        quantify urban air pollution and its impacts on human health and
        environment. Advances in low-cost portable air pollution sensors have
        enabled air pollution monitoring deployments at scale to measure air
        pollution at high spatiotemporal resolution. However, it is challenging
        to ensure the accuracy of these low-cost sensor deployments because the
        sensors are more error-prone than high-end sensing infrastructures and
        they are often deployed in harsh environments. Sensor calibration has
        proven to be effective to improve the data quality of low-cost sensors
        and maintain the reliability of long-term, distributed sensor
        deployments. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art low-cost air
        pollution sensors, identify their major error sources, and
        comprehensively survey calibration models as well as network
        recalibration strategies suited for different sensor deployments. We
        also discuss limitations of exiting methods and conclude with open
        issues for future sensor calibration research.

      abstract: Driven by applications like Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), driver-less

        the past decade. In recent years, Ultra Wideband (UWB) emerged as a

        indoor and outdoor positioning. But algorithms relying only on UWB
        sensor usually result in high latency and low bandwidth, which is

        this problem, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based algorithm is
        proposed to fuse the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and UWB, which
        achieved 80Hz 3D localization with the significantly improved accuracy
        and almost no delay. To verify the effectiveness and reliability of the

      abstract: This paper proposes a novel search method for a swarm of quadcopter
        drones. In the proposed method, inspired by the phenomena of swarms in
        nature, drones effectively look for the search target by investigating

        The position update mechanism is implemented using the particle swarm
        optimization algorithm as the swarm intelligence (a well-known
        swarm-based optimization algorithm), as well as a dynamic model for the
        drones to take the real-world environment into account. In addition, the

        drones. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified through
        repeated test simulations, including a benchmark function optimization
        and air pollutant search problems. The results show that the proposed

      abstract: In this study, we design and verify an intake system using the wake of
        a pocket-sized quadcopter for the chemical plume tracing (CPT) problem.
        Solving CPT represents an important technique in the field of
        engineering because it can be used to perform rescue operations at the
        time of a disaster and to identify sources of harmful substances. An
        appropriate intake of air when sensing odors plays an important role in
        performing CPT. Hence, we used the air flow generated by a quadcopter
        itself to intake chemical particles into two alcohol sensors. By
        experimental evaluation, we verified that the quadcopter wake intake
        method has good directivity and can be used to realize CPT. Concretely,
        even at various odor source heights, the quadcopter had a
        three-dimensional CPT success rate of at least 70%. These results imply
        that, although a further development of three-dimensional CPT is
        necessary in order to conduct it in unknown and cluttered environments,
        the intake method proposed in this paper enables a pocket-sized

      abstract: In this paper, we present an autonomous aerial robot to reconstruct
        tomographic 2D slices of gas plumes in outdoor environments. Our
        platform, the so-called Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for Remote Gas Sensing
        (UAV-REGAS) combines a lightweight Tunable Diode Laser Absorption
        Spectroscopy (TDLAS) sensor with a 3-axis aerial stabilization gimbal
        for aiming on a versatile octocopter. The TDLAS sensor provides integral
        gas concentration measurements but no information regarding the distance
        traveled by the laser diode's beam or the distribution of the gas along
        the optical path. We complemented the set-up with a laser range-finder
        and apply principles of Computed Tomography (CT) to create a model of
        the spatial gas distribution from these integral concentration
        measurements. To allow for a rudimentary ground truth evaluation of the
        applied gas tomography algorithm, we set up a unique outdoor test
        environment based on two 3D ultrasonic anemometers and a distributed
        array of 10 infrared gas transmitters. We present first results showing
        the 2D plume reconstruction capabilities of the system under realistic

        and apply principles of Computed Tomography (CT) to create a model of
        the spatial gas distribution from these integral concentration
        measurements. To allow for a rudimentary ground truth evaluation of the

      abstract: The measurement of particle matter (PM) of mass concentration by
        low-cost PM sensor is strongly influenced by environmental factors such
        as humidity, temperature, wind speed, wind direction. In this study, we
        developed a machine learning-based calibration method for low-cost
        light-scattering PM sensor. A Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) was used
        to compensate for the effect of environmental factors on the PM
        measurements. Experimental data were collected from 20 March – 6 May
        2018 in central Taiwan, and used to train and evaluate the calibration
        model. Before calibrating PM sensor, the PM2.5 mass concentration of
        low-cost PM sensors have the lowest values of R-squared (R2 ) , with
        0.618±0.033 as compared to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
        approved federal equivalent method (FEM) instrument (BAM-1020, Met One
        Instruments). After calibrating PM sensor by using the FNN calibration
        model, the PM2.5 mass concentration of low-cost PM sensors show the
        highest linearity with an R2 value of 0.905±0.013 for BAM-1020. It
        demonstrated that the machine-learning method could be used to calibrate
        a low-cost PM sensor and improve its accuracy.

      abstract: Sensors drift is one of the most critical challenges while designing
        an Electronic Nose System (ENS). The discrimination and quantification
        of gases in the presence of drift is challenging and requires either (i)
        system recalibration, (ii) domain transformations or (iii) data from
        target domain. This paper proposes a heuristic optimization technique
        integrated with a pattern recognition model to estimate the
        concentration of different industrial gases in the presence of small
        experimental drift. The proposed method is validated against an
        experimental data acquired with an array of 16 screen-protected gas
        sensors. Samples from 6 volatile compounds; ethylene, ethanol, ammonia,
        acetone, acetaldehyde and toluene are tested to validate the proposed
        solution. Besides giving accurate performance in terms of concentration
        estimation the proposed solution does not require system recalibration,
        domain transformations or target domain data and meanwhile it also
        reduces the computational complexity of the system.

      abstract: "Abstract.  The number of applications involving unmanned aerial
        vehicles (UAVs) grew dramatically during the last decade. Despite such
        incredible success, the use of drones is still quite limited in GNSS
        denied environment: indeed, the availability of a reliable GNSS
        estimates of the drone position is still fundamental in order to enable
        most of the UAV applications. Given such motivations, in this paper an
        alternative positioning system for UAVs, based on low cost
        ultra-wideband band (UWB) is considered. More specifically, this work
        aims at assessing the positioning accuracy of UWB-based positioning
        thanks to the comparison with positions provided by a motion capture
        (MoCap) system. Since the MoCap accuracy is much higher than that of the
        UWB system, it can be safely used as a reference trajectory for the
        validation of UWB estimates. In the considered experiment the UWB system
        allowed to obtain a root mean square error of 39.4cm in 3D positioning
        based on the use of an adaptive extended Kalman filter, where the
        measurement noise covariance was adaptively estimated."

      abstract: With the emergence and development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),
        different sensors have become more miniaturized and intelligent. UAVs
        equipped with various sensors are now an important approach for
        acquiring spatial data. Many advantages, such as low cost, short
        revisiting cycle, flexibility and high precision, have made UAVs
        powerful tools in geological, agricultural, ecological and forestry
        growth monitoring, as well as evaluation. Now, UAVs are a hotspot in
        scientific research. Their application in mining areas (MA), although
        still in its infancy, is developing rapidly in terms of speed, scale and
        service scope. This research examines aspects such as UAV platforms,
        different sensors and their application fields, as well as reviewing the
        advances of scientific research in MA at the present time. By combining
        current research and the functions of multiple sensors, an application
        framework for UAV monitoring in MA is constructed. Finally, the
        challenge and prospects for the development of UAVs and sensors are also
        considered. This research hopes to provide a technical reference,
        expanding the knowledge and recognition of UAV monitoring in MA, as well
        as an assessment of applications in mining, reclamation and environment.

        development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), different sensors have
        become more miniaturized and intelligent. UAVs equipped with various

        advantages, such as low cost, short revisiting cycle, flexibility and
        high precision, have made UAVs powerful tools in geological,
        agricultural, ecological and forestry growth monitoring, as well as
        evaluation. Now, UAVs are a hotspot in scientific research. Their
        application in mining areas (MA), although still in its infancy, is
        developing rapidly in terms of speed, scale and service scope. This
        research examines aspects such as UAV platforms, different sensors and
        their application fields, as well as reviewing the advances of
        scientific research in MA at the present time. By combining current
        research and the functions of multiple sensors, an application framework
        for UAV monitoring in MA is constructed. Finally, the challenge and
        prospects for the development of UAVs and sensors are also considered.
        This research hopes to provide a technical reference, expanding the
        knowledge and recognition of UAV monitoring in MA, as well as an
        assessment of applications in mining, reclamation and environment.}}

      abstract: Abstract   Source-term estimation (STE) methods attempt to calculate
        the most-likely source characteristics of an atmospheric release given
        concentration observations. The quality of the STE depends partially on
        the time and space scales of the observations, sensor locations, and
        release parameters. We quantify the sensitivity of a probabilistic STE
        algorithm that was previously validated using observational data
        collected during a controlled tracer release experiment to the
        spatiotemporal resolution of observing networks. We have also made many
        improvements to the STE algorithm, which extends applicability to
        coarser-resolution observational datasets. Improvements include the use
        of a fully-connected deep neural network model emulator with dynamically
        optimized architecture and better goodness-of-fit (GoF) metrics to
        measure the discrepancy between model and observational data. The GoF
        metrics, which are more robust and resilient than previous metrics, are
        the Spearman rank-based correlation coefficient and a variation of the
        binary       f    1       classification score adapted for regression
        problems. Using synthetically generated observations over East Asia, the
        skill of the improved algorithm is quantified over a broad range of
        sensor configurations and release scenarios. The evaluation is broken
        into three experiments. First, a validation study shows that the
        proposed GoF metrics perform more reliably than other possible
        candidates. Next, data-denial techniques are applied to a single release
        scenario over the Korean peninsula, where the skill of the inversion is
        shown to be highly sensitive to the number and location of deployed
        sensors but less sensitive to temporal resolution. Finally, the STE
        algorithm is tested for many release locations throughout the geographic
        model domain, where the STE algorithm performs well for all but a few
        cases. The results indicate that the STE algorithm provides informative
        source-parameter posterior probability distributions utilizing data
        collected by sparse sensor networks; however, the skill of the STE
        algorithm improves significantly for higher resolution networks.

        performance of autonomous robots. The paper compares several mapping

        polynomial and piecewise linear interpolation. The methods are compared
        in Monte Carlo simulations using a well known plume model and in indoor

        unmanned vehicles, the indoor experiments were performed in a controlled
        and repeatable manner where a steady state ground truth could be
        obtained in order to properly assess the various regression methods
        using data from a real dispersive source and sensor. The effect of
        sampling time during data collection was assessed with regards to the
        mapping accuracy, and the data collected during the experiments have
        been made available. Overall, the Gaussian Process method was found to
        perform the best among the regression algorithms, showing more
        robustness to the noisy measurements obtained from short sampling
        periods, enabling an accurate map to be produced in significantly less
        time. Finally, plume mapping results are presented in uncontrolled
        outdoor conditions, using an unmanned aerial vehicle, to demonstrate the
        system in a realistic uncontrolled environment.

        point source with eight sampling points arranged in a square pattern,
        and non-point source with 24 sampling points in a grid pattern. The

      abstract: The intermittency of the instantaneous concentration of a turbulent
        chemical plume is a fundamental cue for estimating the chemical source
        distance using chemical sensors. Such estimate is useful in applications
        such as environmental monitoring or localization of fugitive gas
        emissions by mobile robots or sensor networks. However, the inherent
        low-pass filtering of metal oxide (MOX) gas sensors-typically used in
        odor-guided robots and dense sensor networks due to their low cost,
        weight and size-hinders the quantification of concentration
        intermittency. In this paper, we design a digital differentiator to
        invert the low-pass dynamics of the sensor response, thus obtaining a
        much faster signal from which the concentration intermittency can be
        effectively computed. Using a fast photo-ionization detector as a
        reference instrument, we demonstrate that the filtered signal is a good
        approximation of the instantaneous concentration in a real turbulent
        plume. We then extract transient features from the filtered signal-the
        so-called “bouts”-to predict the chemical source distance, focusing on
        the optimization of the filter parameters and the noise threshold to
        make the predictions robust against changing wind conditions. This
        represents an advantage over previous bout-based models which require
        wind measurements-typically taken with expensive and bulky
        anemometers-to produce accurate predictions. The proposed methodology is
        demonstrated in a wind tunnel scenario where a MOX sensor is placed at
        various distances downwind of an emitting chemical source and the wind
        speed varies in the range 10-34 cm/s. The results demonstrate that
        models optimized with our methodology can provide accurate source
        distance predictions at different wind speeds.

        Access},abstract={The intermittency of the instantaneous concentration
        of a turbulent chemical plume is a fundamental cue for estimating the
        chemical source distance using chemical sensors. Such estimate is useful
        in applications such as environmental monitoring or localization of
        fugitive gas emissions by mobile robots or sensor networks. However, the
        inherent low-pass filtering of metal oxide (MOX) gas sensors-typically
        used in odor-guided robots and dense sensor networks due to their low
        cost, weight and size-hinders the quantification of concentration
        intermittency. In this paper, we design a digital differentiator to
        invert the low-pass dynamics of the sensor response, thus obtaining a
        much faster signal from which the concentration intermittency can be
        effectively computed. Using a fast photo-ionization detector as a
        reference instrument, we demonstrate that the filtered signal is a good
        approximation of the instantaneous concentration in a real turbulent
        plume. We then extract transient features from the filtered signal-the
        so-called “bouts”-to predict the chemical source distance, focusing on
        the optimization of the filter parameters and the noise threshold to
        make the predictions robust against changing wind conditions. This
        represents an advantage over previous bout-based models which require
        wind measurements-typically taken with expensive and bulky
        anemometers-to produce accurate predictions. The proposed methodology is
        demonstrated in a wind tunnel scenario where a MOX sensor is placed at

      abstract: As a source searching method, infotaxis has been used in mobile
        olfactory robots equipped with contact-type MOS (metal oxide
        semiconductor) gas sensors. This method navigates a robot to explore
        more cues in the global space and therefore costs much time at the early
        stage. To solve this problem, this paper presents a line integral
        infotaxis (LII) algorithm which is realized by applying a remote-type
        TDLAS (tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy) gas sensor to the
        infotaxis. In addition, the robot often gets stuck in the place of high
        concentration during the infotaxis searching process, so an odor source
        declaration procedure which is implemented by calculating the odor
        particle flux on a closed curve is added to the LII. Simulation results
        show that the LII algorithm can enormously save time of exploration and
        solve the local convergence problem.

      abstract: Abstract This paper presents a multi-vehicle chemical-plume mapping
        process that incorporates onboard wind speed and direction estimation. A
        Gaussian plume model is exploited to develop the kernel for
        extrapolating the measured data. Compared to the uni- or bi-variate
        kernels, the proposed kernel uses the estimated wind information to
        refine the chemical concentration prediction downwind of the source.
        This new approach, compared to previous mapping methods, relies on fewer
        parameters and provides 30% reduction in the mapping mean-squared error.
        Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the
        approach. Specifically, outdoor flight tests show three aerial robots
        with chemical sensing capabilities mapping a real propane gas leak to
        demonstrate feasibility of the approach.

      abstract: "This paper addresses the problem of estimating the spatial
        distribution of volatile substances using a mobile robot equipped with
        an electronic nose. Our work contributes an effective solution to two
        important problems that have been disregarded so far: First, obstacles
        in the environment (walls, furniture,...) do affect the gas spatial
        distribution. Second, when combining odor measurements taken at
        different instants of time, their `ages' must be taken into account to
        model the ephemeral nature of gas distributions. In order to incorporate
        these two characteristics into the mapping process we propose modeling
        the spatial distribution of gases as a Gaussian Markov random field.
        This mathematical framework allows us to consider both: (i) the
        vanishing information of gas readings by means of a time-increasing
        uncertainty in sensor measurements, and (ii) the influence of objects in
        the environment by means of correlations among the different areas.
        Experimental validation is provided with both, simulated and real-world
        datasets, demonstrating the out-performance of our method when compared
        to previous standard techniques in gas mapping."

        three-dimensional gas distribution mapping with a micro-drone. With the
        3D Kernel DM (kernel extrapolation distribution mapping) algorithm

        distribution map is real-time updated when the micro-drone flies along
        predefined sweeping path to traverse the search area in outdoor
        environments. Results show that the concentration grid map obtained can
        represent the real gas distribution in a certain extent, and demonstrate

        of the tracer concentration are sporadic, noisy and without directional

        link in the lattice indicates a blocked path due to an obstacle. The
        searcher must simultaneously estimate the source parameters, the map of
        the search domain and its own location within the map. The solution is
        formulated in the sequential Bayesian framework and implemented as a

      abstract: We introduce a plume tracking algorithm based on robot formations. The
        algorithm is inherently designed for multi-robot systems, and requires
        at least two robots to collaborate. The robots try to keep themselves
        centered around the plume while moving upwind towards the source, and
        share their odor concentration and wind direction measurements with each
        other. In addition, robots know the relative poses of other team
        members. Systematic experiments with up to 5 real robots in a wind
        tunnel show that the robots achieve close-to-optimal performance in our
        scenario, and by far outperform previous approaches. The performance
        gain is attributed to the fact that robots continuously share
        information about the plume (odor concentration, wind direction) without
        spatially competing for acquiring it.

      abstract: A bionic plume tracing method named the Surge-S algorithm is proposed
        for robot odor source localization problems in outdoor time-varying
        airflow environment. The rapid change of wind direction in the outdoor
        environment leads to a fact that the odor plume released from the odor
        source are changing quickly, winding and intermittent. In this case, the
        robot would easily lose the contact with the odor plume, resulting an
        inefficient plume tracing. In order to track the plume efficiently in
        outdoor time-varying airflow environments, inspired by the plume-tracing
        behavior of the male moth, the Surge-S algorithm is proposed. The
        proposed method makes the robot surge a given distance against the wind
        after the contact with the plume. When the robot loses the contact with
        the plume, it will search the plume like the casting of the moth,
        following a gradually increasing S-shaped path based on the end location
        of the surge and with a center line in upwind direction. The gradually
        increasing S-shaped path is designed to make the robot likely re-meet
        the plume within the area possibly covered by the plume, and thus the
        robot can get into next plume tracing and gradually approaches the odor
        source. Simulation experiments were carried out and the proposed method
        was compared with the classic Spiral-surge algorithm. The simulation
        results show the feasibility and validity of the Surge-S method.

        robot can get into next plume tracing and gradually approaches the odor
        source. Simulation experiments were carried out and the proposed method
        was compared with the classic Spiral-surge algorithm. The simulation
        results show the feasibility and validity of the Surge-S method.}}

      abstract: One of the major disadvantages of the use of Metal Oxide Semiconductor
        (MOS) technology as a transducer for electronic gas sensing devices
        (e-noses) is the long recovery period needed after each gas exposure.
        This severely restricts its usage in applications where the gas
        concentrations may change rapidly, as in mobile robotic olfaction, where
        allowing for sensor recovery forces the robot to move at a very low
        speed, almost incompatible with any practical robot operation. This
        paper describes the design of a new e-nose which overcomes, to a great
        extent, such a limitation. The proposed e-nose, called Multi-Chamber
        Electronic Nose (MCE-nose), comprises several identical sets of MOS
        sensors accommodated in separate chambers (four in our current
        prototype), which alternate between sensing and recovery states,
        providing, as a whole, a device capable of sensing changes in chemical
        concentrations faster. The utility and performance of the MCE-nose in
        mobile robotic olfaction is shown through several experiments involving
        rapid sensing of gas concentration and mobile robot gas mapping.

      abstract: Environmental Monitoring (EM) is typically performed using sensor
        networks that collect measurements in predefined static locations. The
        possibility of having one or more autonomous robots to perform this task
        increases versatility and reduces the number of necessary sensor nodes

        of autonomous moving robots for EM. The main challenges are how to build
        an accurate spatial-temporal model while choosing locations for
        measuring the phenomenon. This paper addresses the problem by using
        Bayesian Optimisation for choosing sensing locations, and presents a new
        utility function that takes into account the distance travelled by a
        moving robot. The proposed methodology is tested in simulation and in a

      abstract: This paper addresses the problem of autonomous navigation of a micro
        air vehicle (MAV) in GPS-denied environments. We present experimental
        validation and analysis for our system that enables a quadrotor
        helicopter, equipped with a laser range finder sensor, to autonomously
        explore and map unstructured and unknown environments. The key challenge
        for enabling GPS-denied flight of a MAV is that the system must be able
        to estimate its position and velocity by sensing unknown environmental
        structure with sufficient accuracy and low enough latency to stably
        control the vehicle. Our solution overcomes this challenge in the face
        of MAV payload limitations imposed on sensing, computational, and
        communication resources. We first analyze the requirements to achieve
        fully autonomous quadrotor helicopter flight in GPS-denied areas,
        highlighting the differences between ground and air robots that make it
        difficult to use algorithms developed for ground robots. We report on
        experiments that validate our solutions to key challenges, namely a
        multilevel sensing and control hierarchy that incorporates a high-speed
        laser scan-matching algorithm, data fusion filter, high-level
        simultaneous localization and mapping, and a goal-directed exploration
        module. These experiments illustrate the quadrotor helicopter's ability
        to accurately and autonomously navigate in a number of large-scale
        unknown environments, both indoors and in the urban canyon. The system
        was further validated in the field by our winning entry in the 2009
        International Aerial Robotics Competition, which required the quadrotor
        to autonomously enter a hazardous unknown environment through a window,
        explore the indoor structure without GPS, and search for a visual

      abstract: This paper discusses odor source localization (OSL) using a mobile
        robot in an outdoor time-variant airflow environment. A novel OSL
        algorithm based on particle filters (PF) is proposed. When the odor
        plume clue is found, the robot performs an exploratory behavior, such as
        a plume-tracing strategy, to collect more information about the
        previously unknown odor source. In parallel, the information collected
        by the robot is exploited by the PF-based OSL algorithm to estimate the
        location of the odor source in real time. The process of the OSL is
        terminated if the estimated source locations converge within a given
        small area. The Bayesian-inference-based method is also performed for
        comparison. Experimental results indicate that the proposed PF-based OSL
        algorithm performs better than the Bayesian-inference-based OSL method.

      abstract: Gas distribution mapping is a crucial task in emission monitoring and
        search and rescue applications. A common assumption made by state-of-the
        art mapping algorithms is that only one type of gaseous substance is
        present in the environment. For real world applications, this assumption
        can become very restrictive. In this paper we present an algorithm that
        creates gas concentration maps in a scenario where multiple
        heterogeneous gas sources are present. First, using an array of metal
        oxide (MOX) sensors and a pattern recognition algorithm, the chemical
        compound is identified. Then, for each chemical compound a gas
        concentration map using the readings of a Photo Ionization Detector
        (PID) is created. The proposed approach has been validated in
        experiments with the sensors mounted on a mobile robot which performed a
        predefined trajectory in a room where two gas sources emitting
        respectively ethanol and 2-propanol have been placed.

      abstract: This paper describes a method for enhancing classification performance
        of an electronic nose (E-nose) when measuring odors or flavors in

        to analyze the frequency characteristic of sensor response. The response
        of a gas sensor when exposed to an odor in ambient air, which is not in
        a closed system such as a chamber or sample headspace, is usually
        fluctuating due to odor concentration change caused by wind. The feature
        vectors of odor samples are created by using properly-selected frequency
        components. The results of principal component analysis (PCA) to the
        feature vectors indicate that the proposed feature extraction method can
        enhance the odor classification performance of electronic nose when used
        for measuring odors in ambient air.

      abstract: This paper describes the design, construction and validation of a
        mobile sensory platform for greenhouse monitoring. The complete system
        consists of a sensory system on board a small quadrotor (i.e., a four
        rotor mini-UAV). The goals of this system include taking measures of
        temperature, humidity, luminosity and CO2 concentration and plotting
        maps of these variables. These features could potentially allow for
        climate control, crop monitoring or failure detection (e.g., a break in
        a plastic cover). The sensors have been selected by considering the
        climate and plant growth models and the requirements for their
        integration onboard the quadrotor. The sensors layout and placement have
        been determined through a study of quadrotor aerodynamics and the
        influence of the airflows from its rotors. All components of the system
        have been developed, integrated and tested through a set of field
        experiments in a real greenhouse. The primary contributions of this
        paper are the validation of the quadrotor as a platform for measuring

      abstract: This paper proposes a new method for classification of gases/odors
        called average slope multiplication (ASM) using dynamic characteristics
        of thick film gas sensor array. The instantaneous values of the
        extracted dynamic response/recovery plots for various test gases viz.,
        LPG, CCl4, CO, and C3H7OH were correlated to its neighboring response
        plots by the use of proposed ASM technique. It has been demonstrated
        that the proposed method offers excellent results for classification of
        gases/odors using the dynamic responses of thick film gas sensor array.
        Principal component analysis (PCA) has been further used for data
        preprocessing and dimensionality reduction. The extracted raw data, the
        ASM transformed data, and PCA preprocessed ASM data were trained and
        tested using the back-propagation neural network (BPNN). The results
        thus obtained have been studied and presented here. Cross validation
        scheme was adopted for all analysis. The BPNN trained and tested with
        raw data showed 86% classification accuracy, whereas the raw data after
        PCA preprocessing showed 90% classification. The ASM data showed 97%
        classification accuracy while ASM data with PCA preprocessing showed the
        best results giving 100% classification accuracy with duly trained BPNN.
        We therefore report that superior identification of gases/odors can be
        obtained using the dynamic response of gas sensor array with the
        proposed ASM method.

      mag_id: "2059271594"
      journal: Journal of Medical Toxicology
      abstract: The World Health Organization estimates that particulate matter (PM)
        air pollution contributes to approximately 800,000 premature deaths each
        year, ranking it the 13th leading cause of mortality worldwide. However,
        many studies show that the relationship is deeper and far more
        complicated than originally thought. PM is a portion of air pollution
        that is made up of extremely small particles and liquid droplets
        containing acids, organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles.
        PM is categorized by size and continues to be the fraction of air
        pollution that is most reliably associated with human disease. PM is
        thought to contribute to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease by
        the mechanisms of systemic inflammation, direct and indirect coagulation
        activation, and direct translocation into systemic circulation. The data
        demonstrating PM's effect on the cardiovascular system are strong.
        Populations subjected to long-term exposure to PM have a significantly
        higher cardiovascular incident and mortality rate. Short-term acute
        exposures subtly increase the rate of cardiovascular events within days
        of a pollution spike. The data are not as strong for PM's effects on
        cerebrovascular disease, though some data and similar mechanisms suggest
        a lesser result with smaller amplitude. Respiratory diseases are also
        exacerbated by exposure to PM. PM causes respiratory morbidity and
        mortality by creating oxidative stress and inflammation that leads to
        pulmonary anatomic and physiologic remodeling. The literature shows PM
        causes worsening respiratory symptoms, more frequent medication use,
        decreased lung function, recurrent health care utilization, and
        increased mortality. PM exposure has been shown to have a small but
        significant adverse effect on cardiovascular, respiratory, and to a
        lesser extent, cerebrovascular disease. These consistent results are
        shown by multiple studies with varying populations, protocols, and
        regions. The data demonstrate a dose-dependent relationship between PM
        and human disease, and that removal from a PM-rich environment decreases
        the prevalence of these diseases. While further study is needed to
        elucidate the effects of composition, chemistry, and the PM effect on

        of Medical Toxicology},abstract={The World Health Organization estimates
        that particulate matter (PM) air pollution contributes to approximately
        800,000 premature deaths each year, ranking it the 13th leading cause of
        mortality worldwide. However, many studies show that the relationship is
        deeper and far more complicated than originally thought. PM is a portion
        of air pollution that is made up of extremely small particles and liquid
        droplets containing acids, organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust
        particles. PM is categorized by size and continues to be the fraction of
        air pollution that is most reliably associated with human disease. PM is
        thought to contribute to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease by
        the mechanisms of systemic inflammation, direct and indirect coagulation
        activation, and direct translocation into systemic circulation. The data
        demonstrating PM's effect on the cardiovascular system are strong.
        Populations subjected to long-term exposure to PM have a significantly
        higher cardiovascular incident and mortality rate. Short-term acute
        exposures subtly increase the rate of cardiovascular events within days
        of a pollution spike. The data are not as strong for PM's effects on
        cerebrovascular disease, though some data and similar mechanisms suggest
        a lesser result with smaller amplitude. Respiratory diseases are also
        exacerbated by exposure to PM. PM causes respiratory morbidity and
        mortality by creating oxidative stress and inflammation that leads to
        pulmonary anatomic and physiologic remodeling. The literature shows PM
        causes worsening respiratory symptoms, more frequent medication use,
        decreased lung function, recurrent health care utilization, and
        increased mortality. PM exposure has been shown to have a small but
        significant adverse effect on cardiovascular, respiratory, and to a
        lesser extent, cerebrovascular disease. These consistent results are
        shown by multiple studies with varying populations, protocols, and
        regions. The data demonstrate a dose-dependent relationship between PM
        and human disease, and that removal from a PM-rich environment decreases
        the prevalence of these diseases. While further study is needed to
        elucidate the effects of composition, chemistry, and the PM effect on
        susceptible populations, the preponderance of data shows that PM
        exposure causes a small but significant increase in human morbidity and
        mortality. Most sources agree on certain “common sense” recommendations,
        although there are lonely limited data to support them. Indoor PM
        exposure can be reduced by the usage of air conditioning and particulate
        filters, decreasing indoor combustion for heating and cooking, and
        smoking cessation. Susceptible populations, such as the elderly or

      abstract: Robots are generally equipped with at least several different
        modalities of sensors. Vision and range sensors are the most popular,
        especially in mobile robots. On the other hand, olfaction (or chemical
        sensing in general) had long been ignored in the robotics community
        because of the technical difficulties involved in realizing artificial
        olfaction on robotic platforms. Over the past two decades, however,
        various attempts are made to use chemical sensors in robotic
        applications. With the help of chemical sensors, mobile robots can
        follow chemical trails laid on the ground, track chemical plumes to find
        their sources, and build distribution maps of chemical substances. This

      abstract: Robots with gas sensing capabilities can address tasks like monitoring
        of polluted areas, detection of gas leaks, exploration of hazardous
        zones or search for explosives. Most of the currently available gas
        sensing technologies suffer from a number of shortcomings like lack of
        selectivity (the sensor responds to more than one chemical compound),
        slow response, drift in the response, and cross-sensitivity to physical
        variables like temperature and humidity. The main topic of this
        dissertation is the discrimination of gases, therefore the scarce
        selectivity and slow response are the limitations of direct concern. One
        of the possible solutions to overcome the poor selectivity of a single
        sensor is to use an array of gas sensors and to interpret the response
        of the whole array using signal processing techniques and pattern
        recognition algorithms. This is an established technology as long as the
        sensors are placed in a measuring chamber. However, discrimination of
        gases with a mobile robot presents additional challenges because the
        sensors are directly exposed to the highly dynamic environment to be
        analyzed. Given the slow dynamics of the sensors, the steady-state of
        the response is never achieved and therefore the discrimination has to
        be performed on the transient phase. The contributions presented in the
        summarized thesis focus around the design of algorithms for gas
        identification in the transient phase, thus they are particularly suited
        to mobile robotics applications.

      abstract: Applications related to industrial plant surveillance and
        environmental monitoring often require the creation of gas distribution
        maps (GDM). In this paper an approach for creating a gas distribution
        map using a Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) sensor
        and a laser range scanner mounted on a pan tilt unit is presented. The
        TDLAS sensor can remotely sense the target gas, in this case methane,
        requiring novel GDM algorithms compared to the ones developed for
        traditional in-situ chemical sensors. The presented setup makes it
        possible to create a 3D model of the environment and to calculate the
        path travelled by the TDLAS beam. The knowledge of the beam path is of
        crucial importance since a TDLAS sensor provides an integral measurement
        of the gas concentration over that path. An efficient GDM algorithm
        based on a quadratic programming formulation is proposed. The approach
        is tested in an indoor scenario where transparent bottles filled with
        methane are successfully localized.

        related to industrial plant surveillance and environmental monitoring
        often require the creation of gas distribution maps (GDM). In this paper
        an approach for creating a gas distribution map using a Tunable Diode
        Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) sensor and a laser range scanner
        mounted on a pan tilt unit is presented. The TDLAS sensor can remotely
        sense the target gas, in this case methane, requiring novel GDM
        algorithms compared to the ones developed for traditional in-situ
        chemical sensors. The presented setup makes it possible to create a 3D
        model of the environment and to calculate the path travelled by the
        TDLAS beam. The knowledge of the beam path is of crucial importance
        since a TDLAS sensor provides an integral measurement of the gas
        concentration over that path. An efficient GDM algorithm based on a
        quadratic programming formulation is proposed. The approach is tested in
        an indoor scenario where transparent bottles filled with methane are
        successfully localized.}}

      abstract: This work presents a gas discrimination approach for Open Sampling
        Systems (OSS), composed of non-specific metal oxide sensors only. In an
        OSS, as used on robots or in sensor networks, the sensors are exposed to
        the dynamics of the environment and thus, most of the data corresponds
        to highly diluted samples while high concentrations are sparse. In
        addition, a positive correlation between class separability and
        concentration level can be observed. The proposed approach computes the
        class posteriors by coupling the pairwise probabilities between the
        compounds to a confidence model based on an estimation of the
        concentration. In this way a rejection posterior, analogous to the
        detection limit of the human nose, is learned. Evaluation was conducted
        in indoor and outdoor sites, with an OSS equipped robot, in the presence
        of two gases. The results show that the proposed approach achieves a
        high classification performance with a low sensitivity to the selection
        of meta parameters.

      abstract: This paper presents an algorithm to trace an odour plume using swarm

        the gap between single and multiple element systems by mimicking and
        enhancing biologically derived strategies for odor plume tracking.
        Simulations were carried out on Webots to verify the potential of the
        algorithm. A simple gas sensor model was introduced to mimic the
        response of a real metal oxide sensor in the simulation. A gas sensor
        model was introduced based on the response of metal oxide sensor (MOS)
        to closely mimic and provide real environment condition. Different
        weightage configurations of the gas sensor, kg and wind sensor, kw are
        compared to find its effects on the performance and behavior of the
        purposed algorithm. It was found that robots separated from the swarm
        can still perform the plume tracking task. Also, multiple entity systems
        show an increase in performance compared to single entity robots.

        higher density than their neighbors and by a relatively large distance
        from points with higher densities. This idea forms the basis of a
        clustering procedure in which the number of clusters arises intuitively,
        outliers are automatically spotted and excluded from the analysis, and
        clusters are recognized regardless of their shape and of the
        dimensionality of the space in which they are embedded. We demonstrate
        the power of the algorithm on several test cases.}}

      abstract: "This paper addresses the collective odor source localization (OSL)
        problem in a time-varying airflow environment using mobile robots. A
        novel OSL methodology which combines odor-source probability estimation
        and multiple robots’ search is proposed. The estimation phase consists
        of two steps: firstly, the separate probability-distribution map of odor
        source is estimated via Bayesian rules and fuzzy inference based on a
        single robot’s detection events; secondly, the separate maps estimated
        by different robots at different times are fused into a combined map by
        way of distance based superposition. The multi-robot search behaviors
        are coordinated via a particle swarm optimization algorithm, where the
        estimated odor-source probability distribution is used to express the
        fitness functions. In the process of OSL, the estimation phase provides
        the prior knowledge for the searching while the searching verifies the
        estimation results, and both phases are implemented iteratively. The
        results of simulations for large-scale advection–diffusion plume

      abstract: This paper presents an adaptive-step-control ASC strategy for
        autonomous chemical plume tracking CPT in both 2D and 3D spaces. The aim
        of CPT is tracking a target chemical flow back to its source and
        declaring its location. While the majority of related works are based on
        wheeled robots in 2D, the rapid development of rotorcrafts makes 3D
        plume tracking possible. Hence, in this paper, we first discuss the
        generalized form of moth-inspired CPT work flow, then extend the
        orthodox moth-inspired CPT from 2D to 3D. More importantly, we also
        propose an ASC strategy to deal with the ?passing-by? problem and to
        gain better control performance. Simulation results are given to
        demonstrate that ASC can solve the inflexibility caused by ?hard? step
        length in diffusive airflow, because it can autonomously adjust the step
        lengths of the robot according to the status of the environment,
        enabling our robot to stride confidently in the low chemical
        concentration areas and focus on highly suspicious areas.

      abstract: Volatile chemical concentration and gas leakage recognition can be
        crucial in environmental monitoring for risk assessment. The use of
        Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to measure spatially distributed gas
        concentration is of great interest because it allows a Simultaneous

        integrated sensing instruments that focus on the optimization of crucial
        features as weight, dimension and energy autonomy, as important as
        selectivity and sensitivity of sensors on board UAVs. The proposed Gas
        Sensing System (GSS) is a fully autonomous board based on a 32bit MCU
        with 30min autonomy (on its own battery), data storing, wireless
        connectivity for real-time feedback and embeds a custom micro-machined
        MOX (Metal Oxide) sensor. This system can be mounted on any UAV thanks
        to its small dimensions and light weight. Experiments demonstrate that
        the sensing performance is not impaired by the air flow during the

        and PN concentration measured in real time. A Linear Regression model
        was used to estimate how the sensor position, relative to the UAV
        center, affects pollutant concentration measurements when the propellers
        are turned on. This research establishes guidelines on how to develop a
        UAV system to measure point source emissions. Such research should be
        undertaken before any UAV system is developed for real world data
        collection.}}

      abstract: In industrial environments, such as metallurgic facilities, human
        operators are exposed to harsh conditions where ambient air is often
        polluted with quartz, dust, lead debris and toxic fumes. Constant
        exposure to respirable particles can cause irreversible health damages
        and thus it is of high interest for occupational health experts to
        monitor the air quality on a regular basis. However, current monitoring
        procedures are carried out sparsely, with data collected in single day
        campaigns limited to few measurement locations. In this paper we explore
        the use and present first experimental results of a novel heterogeneous
        approach that uses a mobile robot and a network of low cost sensing
        nodes. The proposed system aims to address the spatial and temporal
        limitations of current monitoring techniques. The mobile robot, along
        with standard localization and mapping algorithms, allows to produce
        short term, spatially dense representations of the environment where
        dust, gas, ambient temperature and airflow information can be modelled.
        The sensing nodes on the other hand, can collect temporally dense (and
        usually spatially sparse) information during long periods of time,
        allowing in this way to register for example, daily variations in the
        pollution levels. Using data collected with the proposed system in an
        steel foundry, we show that a heterogeneous approach provides dense
        spatio-temporal information that can be used to improve the working
        conditions in industrial facilities.

      abstract: Mobile robots are routinely deployed to support fire brigades in
        search and rescue missions. To help the robot evaluate situations
        involving fires, a novel multi-sensor module has been designed and
        implemented. Ambient air is drawn into inner chambers by a micro air
        pump and then parameters including temperature, humidity, airflow rate,
        particle (smoke) density, critical toxic, hazardous and explosive
        gases/VOC levels are recorded. Three different kinds of gas sensor have
        been incorporated into the module, which are metal oxide (MOX) gas
        sensor, Solidly Mounted Resonator (SMR) sensor, and Non-Dispersive
        Infrared (NDIR) gas sensor; targeting CO, NO 2 , CO 2 , toluene and
        ammonia. The gas sensing unit is deployed on a commercial robot and
        performs well under simulated smoke conditions.

      abstract: Ultra-wideband (UWB) is a promising positioning system that has
        undergone massive research development in recent years. Most UWB systems
        assume prior knowledge on the positions of the UWB anchors. Without
        knowing the anchor positions, an accurate position estimate of a user is
        difficult. Hence, this paper presents a novel simultaneous localization
        and mapping (SLAM) approach for pedestrian localization using a UWB
        system, where the locations of the anchors are unknown. We fuse the
        distance estimates of the UWB system with heading information obtained
        from an inertial measurement unit (IMU). We evaluate the proposed
        algorithm based on measurements with a moving pedestrian and fixed
        anchors with unknown positions. The evaluations show that an accurate
        position estimation of both the pedestrian and the anchors is possible
        without any prior knowledge on the anchor positions.

      abstract: In this paper we present a statistical method to build
        three‐dimensional gas distribution maps (3D‐DM). The proposed mapping
        technique uses kernel extrapolation with a tri‐variate Gaussian kernel
        that models the likelihood that a reading represents the concentration
        distribution at a distant location in the three dimensions. The method
        is evaluated using a mobile robot equipped with three “e‐noses” mounted
        at different heights. Initial experiments in an uncontrolled indoor
        environment are presented and evaluated with respect to the ability of
        the 3D map, computed from the lower and upper nose, to predict the map
        from the middle nose.

      abstract: Locating gradient sources and tracking them over time has important
        applications to environmental monitoring and studies of the ecosystem.
        We present an approach, inspired by bacterial chemotaxis, for robots to
        navigate to sources using gradient measurements and a simple actuation
        strategy (biasing a random walk). Extensive simulations show the
        efficacy of the approach in varied conditions including multiple
        sources, dissipative sources, and noisy sensors and actuators. We also
        show how such an approach could be used for boundary finding. We
        validate our approach by testing it on a small robot (the robomote) in a
        phototaxis experiment. A comparison of our approach with gradient
        descent shows that while gradient descent is faster, our approach is
        better suited for boundary coverage, and performs better in the presence
        of multiple and dissipative sources.

      abstract: As a sub-task of the general gas source localisation problem, gas
        souree tracing is supposed to guide a gas-sensitive mobile system
        towards a souree by using the cues determined from the gas distribution
        sensed along a driven path. This paper reports on an investigation of a
        biologically inspired gas source tracing strategy. Similar to the
        behaviour of the silkworm moth Bambyx mori, the implemented behaviour
        consists of a fixed motion pattern that realises a local search, and a
        meehanism that (re-)starts this motion pattern if an increased gas
        concentration is sensed. While the moth uses the local airftow direction
        to orient the motion pattern, this is not possible for a mobile robot
        due to the detection limits of eurrently available anemometers. Thus, an
        alternative method was implemented that uses an asymmetric motion
        pattern, which is biased towards the side where higher gas sensor
        readings were obtained. The adaptated strategy was implemented and
        tested on an experimental platform. This paper describes the strategy
        and evaluates its performance in terms of the ability to drive the robot
        towards a gas souree and to keep it within close proximity of the
        source.

      abstract: "The patterns of stimulus available to moths flying along pheromone
        plumes in a 3-m-long wind tunnel were characterized using a high
        frequency photoionization detector in conjunction with an inert tracer
        gas. Four contrasting flow regimes and source conditions were produced:
        odor released in pulses from a vertical and horizontal array of four
        sources, odor released continuously from a point source, and odor
        released continuously from a point source into an oscillatory wake.
        Although the four flow regimes produced plumes of intermittent and
        fluctuating concentration, there were considerable differences in the
        structure of the signal presented to the sensor. Pulses of tracer gas
        released at 10 Hz retained most of their longitudinal and lateral
        separation. The plume growing in the disturbed flow (`oscillatory'), was
        broader in its lateral extent than the plume growing in an undisturbed
        flow (`continuous'), and the concentrations in the former were lower at
        each downstream position. The signal recorded in the disturbed flow had
        higher intermittency, but the ratio between the peak concentration and
        the signal mean was lower than in the continuous plume. Time scales were
        typically longer in the tunnel than in a field setting, but length
        scales and the main features of intermittency and fluctuation were
        similar. Moths flying along plumes of pheromone in this and similar wind
        tunnels typically slow their velocity and narrow the lateral excursions
        of their flight track as they approach a pheromone source. Which

      abstract: Influenced by turbulence, the practical odor plume in ventilated
        indoor environments is fluctuant and intermittent. Moreover, the bigger
        eddies can easily lead to longtime local maxima. All these make the odor
        source localization quite complicated. A Probability Particle Swarm
        Optimization (P-PSO) algorithm is proposed for multi-robot based odor
        source localization in ventilated indoor environments. The P-PSO
        algorithm uses probability to express fitness function. In this paper,
        the odor source probability, which is estimated by Bayesian inference
        and variable-universe fuzzy inference, is taken as the fitness function.
        To validate the proposed search strategy, four different odor plumes
        corresponding to the real boundary conditions of an indoor environment
        are set up. Considering the response and recovery time of actual odor
        sensors, a second-order sensor model is built. Simulation results
        demonstrate the feasibility and advantage of the proposed P-PSO
        algorithm for multi-robot based odor source localization in ventilated

      abstract: We explored the utility of odor-gated rheotaxis (OGR) with a
        biomimetic robot. OGR is a widely accepted biological plume-tracing
        strategy that uses mean flow and chemical detection for guidance. In
        experiments which contrasted the `classic' single-sensor formulation of
        the strategy against one which used two sensors and against another
        which combined the use of two sensors and memory of past stimulation
        patterns we quantified the relative advantages of each. The use of two,
        spatially separated, chemical sensors confers a significant advantage
        and still greater performance is obtained with rudimentary memory. The
        performance of the American lobster under the same turbulent dispersal
        regime leads us to conclude that significantly more effective plume
        tracing strategies remain to be discovered.

      journal: Open Access Emergency Medicine
      abstract: "Objective: The objective of this investigation was to determine if a
        photoionization detector (PID) could be used to detect the presence of a
        simulated harmful chemical on simulated casualties of a chemical
        release. Methods: A screening protocol, based on existing radiation
        screening protocols, was developed for the purposes of the
        investigation. Three simulated casualties were contaminated with a
        simulated chemical agent and two groups of emergency responders were
        involved in the trials. The success-failure ratio of the participants
        was used to judge the performance of the PID in this application.
        Results: A high success rate was observed when the screening protocol
        was properly adhered to (97.67%). Conversely, the success rate suffered
        when participants deviated from the protocol (86.31%). With one
        exception, all failures were noted to have been the result of a failure
        to correctly observe the established screening protocol. Conclusions:
        The results of this investigation indicate that the PID may be an
        effective screening tool for emergency responders. However, additional
        study is necessary to both confirm the effectiveness of the PID and
        refine the screening protocol if necessary."

      abstract: In recent years there has been growing evidence that Mars once had a
        warm, wet environment that was capable of supporting life. This leads to
        questions as to whether life ever arose on the planet. Space agencies
        are actively supporting projects to answer this question. As part of
        that effort, this paper proposes a robotic system to rapidly scan large
        areas of the Martian surface for specific biogenic gases in the
        atmosphere. The long-term goal of the project is to develop a system
        that can locate local emissions of water vapor and biogases on Mars. The
        paper presents preliminary proof of concept experiments for a practical
        robotic measurement system to search for biogenic gases on Mars. In this
        work, an open path spectrometer to measure the biogenic gas ammonia was
        developed and deployed on a rover. Initial tests in an outdoor setting
        indicate that the system is effective in measuring ammonia. Difficulties
        in taking measurements outdoors include compensating for wind gusts and
        changes in ambient lighting. The paper proposes improvements in the
        current system that will compensate for current limitations and allow
        measurements to be taken over longer distances.

      abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of learning a two dimensional
        spatial model of a gas distribution with a mobile robot. Building maps
        that can be used to accurately predict the gas concentration at query
        locations is a challenging task due to the chaotic nature of gas
        dispersal. We present an approach that formulates this task as a
        regression problem. To deal with the specific properties of typical gas
        distributions, we propose a sparse Gaussian process mixture model. This
        allows us to accurately represent the smooth background signal as well
        as areas of high concentration. We integrate the sparsification of the
        training data into an EM procedure used for learning the mixture
        components and the gating function. Our approach has been implemented
        and tested using datasets recorded with a real mobile robot equipped
        with an electronic nose. We demonstrate that our models are well suited
        for predicting gas concentrations at new query locations and that they
        outperform alternative methods used in robotics to carry out in this
        task.

      abstract: This paper provides a combination of chemotaxic and anemotaxic
        modeling, known as odor-gated rheotaxis (OGR), to solve real-world odor
        source localization problems. Throughout the history of trying to
        mathematically localize an odor source, two common biometric approaches
        have been used. The first approach, chemotaxis, describes how particles
        flow according to local concentration gradients within an odor plume.
        Chemotaxis is the basis for many algorithms, such as particle swarm
        optimization (PSO). The second approach is anemotaxis, which measures
        the direction and velocity of a fluid flow, thus navigating "upstream"
        within a plume to localize its source. Although both chemotaxic and
        anemotaxic based algorithms are capable of solving overly-simplified
        odor localization problems, such as dynamic-bit-matching or
        moving-parabola problems, neither method by itself is adequate to
        accurately address real life scenarios. In the real world, odor
        distribution is multi-peaked due to obstacles in the environment.
        However, by combining the two approaches within a modified PSO-based
        algorithm, odors within an obstacle-filled environment can be localized
        and dynamic advection-diffusion problems can be solved. Thus, robots
        containing this modified particle swarm optimization algorithm (MPSO)
        can accurately trace an odor to its source

        diffusion, which results in a patchy, chaotically fluctuating gas

        gradient were investigated. Both strategies were shown to be of

      abstract: Chemotactic bacteria are guided towards the source of a nutrient by
        local concentration gradients. That works on the microscopic scale, but
        at larger scales such local cues are unreliable pointers — for example,
        wind or water currents may disperse odours sought by foraging animals.
        Using statistical techniques, Vergassola et al. have developed a general
        search algorithm for movement strategies based on the detection of
        sporadic cues and partial information. The strategy, termed 'infotaxis'
        as it maximizes the expected rate of information gain, could find
        application in the design of 'sniffer' robots. A computational model of
        odour plume propagation and experimental data are used to devise a
        general search algorithm for movement strategies in chemotaxis, based on
        sporadic cues and partial information. The strategy is termed
        'infotaxis' as it locally maximizes the expected rate of information
        gain. Chemotactic bacteria rely on local concentration gradients to
        guide them towards the source of a nutrient1. Such local cues pointing
        towards the location of the source are not always available at
        macroscopic scales because mixing in a flowing medium breaks up regions
        of high concentration into random and disconnected patches. Thus,
        animals sensing odours in air or water detect them only intermittently
        as patches sweep by on the wind or currents2,3,4,5,6. A macroscopic
        searcher must devise a strategy of movement based on sporadic cues and
        partial information. Here we propose a search algorithm, which we call
        ‘infotaxis’, designed to work under such conditions. Any search process
        can be thought of as acquisition of information on source location; for
        infotaxis, information plays a role similar to concentration in
        chemotaxis. The infotaxis strategy locally maximizes the expected rate
        of information gain. We demonstrate its efficiency using a computational
        model of odour plume propagation and experimental data on mixing flows7.
        Infotactic trajectories feature ‘zigzagging’ and ‘casting’ paths similar
        to those observed in the flight of moths8. The proposed search algorithm
        is relevant to the design of olfactory robots9,10,11, but the general
        idea of infotaxis can be applied more broadly in the context of
        searching with sparse information.

      title: Maximum entropy sampling and optimal Bayesian experimental design

      abstract: When Shannon entropy is used as a criterion in the optimal design of
        experiments, advantage can be taken of the classical identity
        representing the joint entropy of parameters and observations as the sum
        of the marginal entropy of the observations and the preposterior
        conditional entropy of the parameters. Following previous work in which
        this idea was used in spatial sampling, the method is applied to
        standard parameterized Bayesian optimal experimental design. Under
        suitable conditions, which include non-linear as well as linear
        regression models, it is shown in a few steps that maximizing the
        marginal entropy of the sample is equivalent to minimizing the
        preposterior entropy, the usual Bayesian criterion, thus avoiding the
        use of conditional distributions. It is shown using this marginal
        formulation that under normality assumptions every standard model which
        has a two-point prior distribution on the parameters gives an optimal
        design supported on a single point. Other results include a new
        asymptotic formula which applies as the error variance is large and
        bounds on support size.

      abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of learning two-dimensional
        spatial models of gas distributions. To build models of gas
        distributions that can be used to accurately predict the gas
        concentration at query locations is a challenging task due to the
        chaotic nature of gas dispersal. We formulate this task as a regression
        problem. To deal with the specific properties of gas distributions, we
        propose a sparse Gaussian process mixture model, which allows us to
        accurately represent the smooth background signal and the areas with
        patches of high concentrations. We furthermore integrate the
        sparsification of the training data into an EM procedure that we apply
        for learning the mixture components and the gating function. Our
        approach has been implemented and tested using datasets recorded with a
        real mobile robot equipped with an electronic nose. The experiments
        demonstrate that our technique is well-suited for predicting gas
        concentrations at new query locations and that it outperforms
        alternative and previously proposed methods in robotics.

      abstract: Four chemical plume-tracking algorithms have been compared using a

        information from a wind sensor and a single chemical sensor to determine
        how the agent should move to locate the source of the chemical plume.
        The performance of the robot using each of the algorithms was tested in
        a wind tunnel under a range of wind speeds (0.55, 0.95, and 1.4 m/s)
        using a model chemical (ionized air). The robot was capable of tracking
        the ion plume to its source effectively with each algorithm, having an
        overall success rate of over 85%. The simplest implemented algorithm,
        surge anemotaxis, was found to be the fastest. However, the shape of the
        tracking paths observed indicated that this simple algorithm may not
        explain the plume-tracking behavior of certain insects as well as the
        other algorithms tested. Further tests are required to see if the surge

      abstract: This paper presents a new approach to trajectory optimization for
        autonomous fixed-wing aerial vehicles performing large-scale maneuvers.
        The main result is a planner which designs nearly minimum time planar
        trajectories to a goal, constrained by no-fly zones and the vehicle's
        maximum speed and turning rate. Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
        is used for the optimization, and is well suited to trajectory
        optimization because it can incorporate logical constraints, such as
        no-fly zone avoidance, and continuous constraints, such as aircraft
        dynamics. MILP is applied over a receding planning horizon to reduce the
        computational effort of the planner and to incorporate feedback. In this
        approach, MILP is used to plan short trajectories that extend towards
        the goal, but do not necessarily reach it. The cost function accounts
        for decisions beyond the planning horizon by estimating the time to
        reach the goal from the plan's end point. This time is estimated by
        searching a graph representation of the environment. This approach is
        shown to avoid entrapment behind obstacles, to yield near-optimal
        performance when comparison with the minimum arrival time found using a
        fixed horizon controller is possible, and to work consistently on large
        trajectory optimization problems that are intractable for the fixed
        horizon controller.

      abstract: In this paper we present a statistical method to build
        three-dimensional gas distribution maps from gas sensor and wind
        measurements obtained with a mobile robot in uncontrolled environments.
        The particular contribution of this paper is to introduce and evaluate
        an algorithm for 3D statistical gas distribution mapping, that takes
        into account airflow information. 3D-Kernel DM+V/W algorithm uses a
        multivariate Gaussian weighting function to model the information
        provided by the gas sensors and an ultrasonic anemometer. The proposed
        algorithm is evaluated with respect to the ability of the obtained
        models to predict unseen measurements. The results based on 15 trials
        with a mobile robot in an indoor environment show improvements in the
        model performance when using the 3D kernel DM+V/W algorithm. Moreover
        the model is able to adapt to the dynamical changes of the environment
        learning the hyper-parameter from the sensors readings.

      abstract: Today, pressured air and gas leaks are typically detected using
        in-situ sensor technology. In this contribution the application of
        passive IR-thermography is proposed to permit remote leak detection by
        assessing the resulting temperature profile disturbance due to expansion
        of pressured gas. Remote measurements are advantageous as they are
        easier and safer to conduct. Scanning high-rise objects can be achieved
        using a ground-bound system without requiring complex climbing. In the
        paper a novel method for automated leak detection by feature extraction
        and pattern recognition is presented. This enables autonomous mobile
        robots with remote leak detection capability.

      abstract: There are many dangerous or toxic substances that release
        characteristic chemicals or contaminants into the atmosphere. Locating
        them by tracking their airborne "scent" may provide a reliable and safe
        method of identifying their locations. Many animals routinely locate
        environmental resources by tracking the chemical plumes they release. A
        robot able to match the performance of these biological examples would
        represent a significant technological advancement and would provide a
        reliable method for locating sources of turbulently dispersed chemicals.
        Working towards this goal, a suitable sensor suite was interfaced to an
        off-the-shelf wheeled robot. Wind sensors were developed and integrated
        on the platform with chemical sensors. The robot is shown to
        autonomously orient to wind and move upwind similar to animals that are
        following a plume. In future work the robot will be used to test odor

      abstract: This paper addresses the problem of mapping the features of a gas
        distribution by creating concentration gridmaps from the data collected
        by a mobile robot equipped with an electronic nose. By contrast to
        metric gridmaps extracted from sonar or laser range scans, a single
        measurement of the electronic nose provides information about a
        comparatively small area. To overcome this problem, a mapping technique

        By contrast to metric gridmaps extracted from sonar or laser range

        about a comparatively small area. To overcome this problem, a mapping
        technique is introduced that uses a Gaussian density function to model

      abstract: Two simple three-dimensional moth inspired odor tracking algorithms,
        Counter-turner and Modified counter-turner, were tested on a robotic

        the crosswind movements, while the Modified counter-turner uses the
        plume centerline. Both algorithms shows some success in tracking the
        plume to it’s source. In addition, flight tracks show promise in

      abstract: The desorption part of MOX's response curves to gases represents the
        dynamic information of gas desorption and oxide recovery on the
        sensitive layer. It contains abundance information and lacks to be well
        investigated. This paper proposes a feature extraction method from the
        desorption part of response curves in phase-space. The method extracts
        only one feature, min(dS t/dt)/max(S t), which is found to be able to
        represent the recovery profile. This feature could be extracted in the
        front part of the recovery process. Besides, it is also found that this
        feature does not change with the reacting time (of the reaction between
        a sensor and a sample) changing. A dataset was used in the paper, which
        was consisted of 189 measurements of 9 VOCs by 5 TGS gas sensors at
        three concentrations. A common feature extraction method that extracted
        integral in phase-space was used as a comparison in sort classification
        with the proposed method. The correct recognition rates of Fisher
        Discriminant Analysis (FDA) with the proposed method and the phase-space
        integral extracting method were 91.5% and 79.9%, respectively. The
        results show that the proposed method is an efficient feature extraction
        method of the recovery profile of response curves.

      abstract: This paper describes the assembly of a mobile odour sensing system and
        investigates its practical operation in an indoor environment without a
        constant airflow. Lacking a constant airflow leads to a problem which
        cannot be neglected in real world applications. The response of the
        metal oxide gas sensors used is dominated by air turbulence rather than
        concentration differences. We show that this problem can be overcome by
        driving the robot with a constant speed, thus adding an extra constant
        airflow relative to the gas sensors location. If the robot's speed is
        not too low the system described proved to be well suited to detect even
        weak odour sources. Since driving with constant speed is an
        indispensable condition to perform the basic tasks of a mobile odour
        sensing system, a new localization strategy is proposed, which takes
        this into account.

      abstract: Gas distribution modelling constitutes an ideal application area for
        mobile robots, which - as intelligent mobile gas sensors - offer several
        advantages compared to stationary sensor networks. In this paper we
        propose the Kernel DM+V algorithm to learn a statistical 2-d gas
        distribution model from a sequence of localized gas sensor measurements.
        The algorithm does not make strong assumptions about the sensing
        locations and can thus be applied on a mobile robot that is not
        primarily used for gas distribution monitoring, and also in the case of
        stationary measurements. Kernel DM+V treats distribution modelling as a
        density estimation problem. In contrast to most previous approaches, it
        models the variance in addition to the distribution mean. Estimating the
        predictive variance entails a significant improvement for gas
        distribution modelling since it allows to evaluate the model quality in
        terms of the data likelihood. This offers a solution to the problem of
        ground truth evaluation, which has always been a critical issue for gas
        distribution modelling. Estimating the predictive variance also provides
        the means to learn meta parameters and to suggest new measurement
        locations based on the current model. We derive the Kernel DM+V
        algorithm and present a method for learning the hyper-parameters. Based
        on real world data collected with a mobile robot we demonstrate the
        consistency of the obtained maps and present a quantitative comparison,
        in terms of the data likelihood of unseen samples, with an alternative
        approach that estimates the predictive variance.

      abstract: In the fast recognition applications of electronic nose, not only the

        being ready for new sample measurement. An electronic nose with nine
        metal oxide (MOX) gas sensors and a method of feature extraction on
        sensor recovery curves were presented in this paper. The electronic nose
        was designed to reduce the recognition time and the response-recovery
        time synchronously. In the sampling module of the electronic nose, there
        were two pumps, which could let the sensor quickly recovered. The
        feature extraction method could rapidly extract features from sensor
        recovery curves with robust information. Nine volatile organic compounds
        (VOCs) gas samples were measured with the electronic nose. The correct
        recognition ratios under 10 and 15 s recognition time are 91.0% and
        95.8%, respectively. The mean response-recovery time of these sensors in
        the measurements was 33.5 s, which was about 42.7% of the
        response-recovery time in typical traditional gas sample measurements.
        The results show that the proposed feature extraction method could
        extract robust information with short recognition time and
        response-recovery time.

      abstract: Gas sensors provide the artificial sense of smell for a mobile robot
        to track an airborne gas/odor plume and to locate its source. However, a
        slow response of gas sensors has been the major factor limiting the
        development of plume-tracking robots. This paper describes a new control
        algorithm that overcomes the limitation. The basic idea is to detect the
        onset of a gas sensor response and start recovery by monitoring the
        relative change in each sensor output. Fast plume tracking is
        accomplished by making the robot take appropriate actions immediately
        when the sensor outputs start changing from one state to another. The
        detection of output change also leads to reliable plume detection and

        or sensitivity mismatch than the previous algorithm based on the
        absolute levels of sensor outputs. Experimental results have shown that

        sensors provide the artificial sense of smell for a mobile robot to
        track an airborne gas/odor plume and to locate its source. However, a
        slow response of gas sensors has been the major factor limiting the
        development of plume-tracking robots. This paper describes a new control
        algorithm that overcomes the limitation. The basic idea is to detect the
        onset of a gas sensor response and start recovery by monitoring the
        relative change in each sensor output. Fast plume tracking is
        accomplished by making the robot take appropriate actions immediately
        when the sensor outputs start changing from one state to another. The
        detection of output change also leads to reliable plume detection and
        comparison of multiple sensor outputs since it is less affected by drift
        or sensitivity mismatch than the previous algorithm based on the
        absolute levels of sensor outputs. Experimental results have shown that

      abstract: Measurements have been made of concentration fluctuations and
        turbulent fluxes for two passive plumes from an elevated and a
        ground-level source in a turbulent boundary layer. For the concentration
        fluctuations, results are presented for the variance, the intermittency,
        peak values of concentration, probability-density functions and spectra.
        The balance of terms in the variance transport equation is examined, as
        is the overall level of fluctuations along the plume. It is shown that
        most of the production of fluctuations occurs very near the source.
        Then, the level of fluctuation decays, roughly in accordance with a
        balance between advection and dissipation. For the turbulent fluxes of
        concentration, results are presented for the vertical and lateral
        fluxes, with the associated behaviour of the vertical and lateral eddy
        diffusivities. The balance of terms in the transport equations for the
        fluxes is examined. The essential differences between vertical diffusion
        from ground-level and elevated sources and between near-field and
        far-field behaviour are shown to be due to the relative importance of
        the advection and diffusion terms in these equations.

      abstract: Biomimetic robots are often used as platforms to evaluate specific
        hypotheses of animal problem solving, or as existence proofs of
        solutions. A closely allied application of biomimetic systems is the
        search for constraints on problems for which human experience of the
        physical world (i.e., through scale mismatch or inadequate sense organs)
        does not provide a basis for the formulation of well constrained
        hypotheses. Our investigations of chemo-orientation to turbulent odor
        sources with Robolobster pursues both of these ends. Parallel tests with
        Robolobster and with real lobsters under the same conditions allow us to
        exclude certain chemo-orientation hypotheses, such as
        concentration-gradient tracking, and to statistically describe potential
        guidance signals available to lobsters tracking in a turbulent plume. In
        this paper we analyze the input-output behavior of a lobster and our
        robot under the same conditions to determine the extent to which the
        robot's purely chemotactic algorithm might be incorporated in the
        lobster. We suggest other chemo-orientation strategies that we believe
        contribute to the differences between robot and lobster behavior in
        terms of the alternative strategies available to the American lobster.

      abstract: A series of tracer experiments studying concentration fluctuations in
        a dispersing plume of pollutant in the atmosphere at ranges of between
        50m and 1000m is described. Experiments were conducted on three
        different field sites in near-neutral or slightly convective
        meteorological conditions. The results show time series which are
        characterised by the intermittent occurrence of periods of fluctuating
        non-zero concentrations, interspersed by periods of essentially zero
        concentration. The spectrum of concentration fluctuations is found to
        display inertial subrange behaviour, characterised by a −2/3 power law
        when nS(n) is plotted against frequency n, where S(n) is the variance
        (of the fluctuation) per unit frequency interval. The spectral peak
        frequency varies with distance from the source. In all cases the
        clipped-normal probability density function (PDF) provides a reasonable
        fit to the concentration PDF. The exponential PDF is less flexible in
        fitting a wide range of experimental conditions, but is slightly
        superior for some short range examples. In the alongwind direction it is
        found that, although there is a rapid initial decrease in fluctuation
        intensity with distance, the intensity seems to approach an
        approximately constant non-zero value at long range. In cross-sections
        of the plume the variation of fluctuation statistics is dominated by the
        varying proportion of time during which the concentration is essentially
        zero. Conditional statistics, calculated from significantly non-zero
        concentrations only, show only slight variations across the plume.
