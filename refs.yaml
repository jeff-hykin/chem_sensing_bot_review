      abstract: To increase the boom width of boom sprayers without adding to the
        overall weight, while ensuring the stability of long-span booms and
        improving the efficiency of boom sprayers, this paper proposes a
        UAVs-UGV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, Unmanned Ground Vehicle) Cooperative
        Boom Sprayer System(UCBSS) based on swarm control. The UCBSS integrates
        the high payload capacity of UGVs with the high maneuverability and
        terrain-independent characteristics of UAVs, simplifying the boom
        structure. Multi-rotor UAVs form a UAV swarm, which segments and
        suspends the boom, collaborating with the UGV to complete the spraying
        operation. A prototype with three UAVs and one UGV was developed,
        featuring a unilateral boom width of 21 m. To meet the operational
        requirements of the UCBSS, PD(Proportional-Derivative) feedback control
        is employed to achieve segmented boom balance, utilizing IMUs(Inertial
        Measurement Unit) installed on each boom section and RTK(Real Time
        Kinematic) positioning modules mounted on the UGV and UAVs. For UAVs-UGV
        cooperative motion control, the Adaptive Feedforward Compensation PD
        Feedback(AFCPF) control method is designed to control the UAV swarm.
        Reinforcement learning is used to train and optimize the control
        parameters. Field test were conducted to validate the UCBSS. The results
        show that in terms of boom balance, the average roll angle of the entire
        boom is 0.014 rad, with an average standard deviation of 0.007 rad,
        demonstrating high stability and mitigating the impact of boom
        elongation. Regarding UAVs-UGV cooperative motion, when using the
        proposed AFCPF control method, the maximum tracking error of the three
        UAVs is 0.204 m, representing a 68.3 % reduction compared to the PD
        control method. The overall average tracking error of the three UAVs is
        0.109 m, a reduction of 60.6 % compared to the PD control method. The
        standard deviations are 0.030 m, 0.038 m, and 0.032 m, respectively,
        representing reductions of 55.2 %, 66.4 %, and 55.6 %, with an overall
        reduction of 59.1 %, verifying the effectiveness and stability of the
        proposed control method. The UCBSS proposed in this paper features a
        wide spraying span, simple structure, high operational stability, and
        easy scalability. Against the backdrop of rapid advancements in UAV and
        related technologies, it provides a novel approach to the development of
        high-efficiency, wide-span boom sprayers.

      abstract: New types of aerial robots (NTARs) have found extensive applications
        in the military, civilian contexts, scientific research, disaster
        management, and various other domains. Compared with traditional aerial
        robots, NTARs exhibit a broader range of morphological diversity,
        locomotion capabilities, and enhanced operational capacities. Therefore,
        this study defines aerial robots with the four characteristics of
        morphability, biomimicry, multi-modal locomotion, and manipulator
        attachment as NTARs. Subsequently, this paper discusses the latest
        research progress in the materials and manufacturing technology,
        actuation technology, and perception and control technology of NTARs.
        Thereafter, the research status of NTAR systems is summarized, focusing
        on the frontier development and application cases of flapping-wing
        micro-air vehicles, perching aerial robots, amphibious robots, and
        operational aerial robots. Finally, the main challenges presented by
        NTARs in terms of energy, materials, and perception are analyzed, and
        the future development trends of NTARs are summarized in terms of size
        and endurance, mechatronics, and complex scenarios, providing a
        reference direction for the follow-up exploration of NTARs.

      abstract: Implementing Networked Aerial Robot Teams (NARTs), such as Unmanned
        Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms and UAV-based networks, is a
        multidisciplinary scientific topic with several high-value contributions
        from distinct backgrounds. Such complex systems contain several
        components, such as communication protocols, swarm coordination
        algorithms, sensor integration and mission planning strategies.
        Developing and deploying NARTs in real-world environments often requires
        balancing these components, which can result in focusing on specific
        aspects while simplifying others. The large diversity of current
        contributions in this area and the constant performance improvements are
        bringing us closer to realising intelligent, efficient, secure,
        reliable, and adaptable aerial robot networks. Therefore, a
        comprehensive, unified analysis can help frame recent literature and
        draw important conclusions for the future improvement of these systems.
        This paper proposes a novel framework for NART literature classification
        based on communication and motion coordination awareness criteria. This
        framework is then used to perform an extensive survey, analysis and
        categorisation of the state of the art of NARTs . On one hand, over 50%
        of the categorised works presented enough awareness to enable the
        implementation of dynamic procedures regarding Communication (63%) and
        Motion Coordination (54%). On another hand, only 17% of the analysed
        works presented the highest level of awareness in one of the NART
        components. Future research challenges regarding the integration of
        these two components will also be identified.

      abstract: Agricultural activities emit an increasing amount of carbon into the
        atmosphere, causing climate change. Carbon sequestration is one of the
        carbon-neutral technologies for reducing carbon emissions by spraying
        biochar in needed places, such as fertilizer places. It is critical to
        monitor carbon emissions and the use of biochar in order to properly
        manage carbon emissions. Prior methods, such as traditional soil or
        manure sample collection and semiautomatic analysis, are expensive and
        time-consuming, and they cannot make decisions in real time. We propose
        long-term, site-specific biochar application management using unmanned
        aircraft vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles equipped with proximity
        radar sensing. Our system takes the strategy that a UAV will land on a
        moving UGV to acquire long-range information with a reliable backup.
        Meanwhile, the UGV has many payload options to supply the UAV's sensing
        and actuation missions. We evaluated our system by using a simulated
        mission approach that contains the analysis of the controller for the
        landing sequence, and real-world vision-based landing marker tracking.
        Results show that our system achieves robustness landing control
        sequence and the error altitude calculation based on computer vision is
        less than ± 0.02 m on average.

      abstract: Industrialized agriculture is the direction of future agricultural
        development, which is developing in the direction of scale,
        diversification, unmanned and integration. The cooperative operation of
        UAV, UGV and UAV-UGV is a hot topic in the field of intelligent
        agricultural multi-machine research. However, at present, most of the
        research projects have not systematically given the solutions of UAV,
        UGV and UAV-UGV collaborative application in the future industrialized
        agriculture. Therefore, we propose the development model of future
        industrialized agriculture, which derives the key technologies and
        applications of agricultural UAV, UGV and UAV-UGV collaboration. We
        summarize and discuss the difficulties and innovative design of the
        application of UAV, UGV and UAV-UGV collaboration technology in the
        future industrialized environment, and analyze the opportunities and
        challenges of the application of UAV, UGV and UAV-UGV collaboration
        technology in combination with future industrialized agricultural
        production. Finally, we describe that more technologies (multi-modal
        sensing technology, embodied intelligent control technology, edge
        computing technology, end-edge cloud collaborative management and
        control technology, virtual reality, augmented reality, etc.) are the
        future research directions for the application of UAV, UGV and UAV-UGV
        collaboration in industrialized agriculture.

        agricultural development, which is developing in the direction of scale,
        diversification, unmanned and integration. The cooperative operation of
        UAV, UGV and UAV-UGV is a hot topic in the field of intelligent
        agricultural multi-machine research. However, at present, most of the
        research projects have not systematically given the solutions of UAV,
        UGV and UAV-UGV collaborative application in the future industrialized
        agriculture. Therefore, we propose the development model of future
        industrialized agriculture, which derives the key technologies and
        applications of agricultural UAV, UGV and UAV-UGV collaboration. We
        summarize and discuss the difficulties and innovative design of the
        application of UAV, UGV and UAV-UGV collaboration technology in the
        future industrialized environment, and analyze the opportunities and
        challenges of the application of UAV, UGV and UAV-UGV collaboration
        technology in combination with future industrialized agricultural
        production. Finally, we describe that more technologies (multi-modal
        sensing technology, embodied intelligent control technology, edge
        computing technology, end-edge cloud collaborative management and
        control technology, virtual reality, augmented reality, etc.) are the
        future research directions for the application of UAV, UGV and UAV-UGV

      abstract: Odor issues from landfills remain a persistent environmental
        challenge, exacerbated by the increasing urbanization and the decreasing
        proximity of residential areas to waste disposal sites. Conventional
        odor measurement methods (e.g., olfactometry, gas chromatography-mass
        spectrometry) have been instrumental in studying landfill emissions and
        addressing odor complaints. However, these methods either rely on
        subjective human assessment or require bulky equipment, limiting their
        large-scale applications on landfill sites. Additionally, real-time odor
        measurement is hindered by the need for on-site air sampling followed by
        detailed panel or lab analysis. To overcome these limitations, there is
        a need to modernize landfill odor assessment through automation,
        enabling air sampling and analysis with rapid response to odor
        complaints. Scaling these odor sensors for instantaneous, widespread
        measurement presents challenges due to the complex and highly variable
        composition of landfill gaseous emissions. The primary odorants include
        volatile compounds (VCs) (e.g., hydrogen sulfide, ammonia) and volatile
        organic compounds (VOCs) (e.g., aromatic hydrocarbons, organic acids).
        This work explores the current state-of-the-art olfactory-based and
        analytical-based methods for landfill odor assessment and examines the
        latest advancements in automated platforms for large-scale measurement,
        such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles
        (UGVs). This work also discusses the integration of graphic information
        system (GIS) and digital twin (DT) technologies for high-resolution
        spatiotemporal odor mapping and multi-modal data analysis (e.g., zoning,
        building classifications). Furthermore, the study provides insights into
        the future convergence of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven analytics,
        hybrid sensor technologies, and cost-effective scalable solutions to
        enhance landfill odor assessment and policy development.

      keywords: Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), UGV-based weed control, Navigation,
        Weed detection, Artificial intelligence (AI)
      abstract: As precision agriculture evolves, unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) have
        become an essential tool for improving weed management techniques,
        offering automated and targeted methods that obviously reduce the
        reliance on manual labor and blanket herbicide applications. Several
        papers on UGV-based weed control methods have been published in recent
        years, yet there is no explicit attempt to systematically study these
        papers to discuss these weed control methods, UGVs adopted, and their
        key components, and how they impact the environment and economy.
        Therefore, the objective of this study was to present a systematic
        review that involves the efficiency and types of weed control methods
        deployed in UGVs, including mechanical weeding, targeted herbicide
        application, thermal/flaming weeding, and laser weeding in the last 2
        decades. For this purpose, a thorough literature review was conducted,
        analyzing 68 relevant articles on weed control methods for UGVs. The
        study found that the research focus on using UGVs in mechanical weeding
        has been more dominant, followed by target or precision spraying/
        chemical weeding, with hybrid weeding systems quickly emerging. The
        effectiveness of UGVs for weed control is hinged on the accuracy of
        their navigation and weed detection technologies, which are influenced
        heavily by environmental conditions, including lighting, weather, uneven
        terrain, and weed and crop density. Also, there is a shift from using
        traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms to deep learning neural
        networks, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent
        neural networks (RNNs), for weed detection algorithm development due to
        their potential to work in complex environments. Finally, trials of most
        UGVs have limited documentation or lack extensive trials under various
        conditions, such as varying soil types, crop fields, topography, field
        geometry, and annual weather conditions. This review paper serves as an
        in-depth update on UGVs in weed management for farmers, researchers,
        robotic technology industry players, and AI enthusiasts, helping to
        further foster collaborative efforts to develop new ideas and advance
        this revolutionary technique in modern agriculture.

      abstract: Because of the recent advances in sensor technology, unmanned ground
        vehicles (UGVs) are equipped with various high-performance sensors to
        improve their mission performance. The energy consumption of the sensors
        is a critical issue because most UGVs operate on rechargeable batteries
        while conducting their missions. In particular, efficient sensing has
        become a crucial challenge due to the growing demand for advanced
        intelligent monitoring missions. However, while previous studies have
        focused on power consumption models for vehicle locomotion, they have
        not fully addressed the high energy consumption of sensors. This study
        proposes an adaptive sensor-management algorithm to address the critical
        issue of energy consumption by considering the monitoring and navigation
        sensors that are widely used in UGV monitoring. After characterizing the
        proposed adaptive sensor-management strategy based on a risk map
        composed of monitoring and saving zones, we present a power consumption
        model to quantify the energy savings of the sensors. Furthermore, the
        optimal interval was derived to minimize power consumption during UGV
        monitoring. The proposed algorithm can minimize the energy consumption
        by adjusting the optimal interval according to the mission environment.
        We demonstrate the results of our analysis through various evaluations.

      abstract: This research work involves data access and control of Unmanned Ground
        Vehicles (UGVs) which is designed for health monitoring of paddy crops
        as an exception from traditional monitoring system. The proposed scheme
        of autonomous navigation of drones is planned to be carried out as per
        the six milestones for disease detection and control in paddy crops.
        Drones serve as Unmanned Robotic Vehicles (URV) capable of performing
        desired tasks in unstructured, uncertain and potentially hostile
        environments and are remotely-operated without human intervention. URVs
        function completely as autonomous entities in diversified environments.
        Current UGVs adhere to different levels of automaticity. Typically the
        vehicle follows high level waypoints spaced for few hundred meters of
        distance to provide monitoring of agricultural fields and early
        detection of the various diseases that may occur in the paddy fields in
        a polyhouse. To increase the vehicle's abilities, tracking efficiency,
        obstacle avoidance, path planning or lead and follow up augmented
        control with Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) is incorporated. The
        distributed autonomous system for information gathering related to the
        paddy crops in polyhouse is enabled using different sensors, which is a
        data-intensive task. To increase the robustness of the system, fuzzy
        controllers are proposed to control the navigation of the proposed UGV
        in “All terrain conditions”. They are needed to offer problem specific
        heuristic control knowledge for the Inference Engine Design which occurs
        due to imprecision and uncertainty of the sensor readings. It also
        requires low computation time which favours the polyhouse situations.
        The navigation of UGV and the FLC action will in turn depend on “All
        terrain traversability” and “dead zone” monitoring. The proposed UGV
        model is capable of measuring the parameters associated with the paddy
        crops inside a polyhouse. The various diseases in paddy crops are False
        Smut (FS), Sheath Blight (SB), Rice Blast (RB), Leaf Scald (LS), Brown
        Spot (BS), Bacterial Leaf Blight (BLB) and Bakane (BE) which are
        detected using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

      abstract: "With the striking development of underground space of smart cities,
        the detection and emergency treatment of underground space has become
        more and more important. At a dangerous search and rescue scene, an
        unmanned ground vehicle can perform the tasks instead of a rescue worker
        such as incident localization, hazardous material identification, toxic
        gas collection, and security surveillance. In this paper, we present a
        novel terrain adaptive omni-directional unmanned ground vehicle (TAOUGV)
        for search and rescue missions in underground space. The proposed system
        consists of three main parts: obstacle detection, terrain adaptive
        mechanical module and control module. In the first part, a binocular
        camera system and an ultrasonic sensor are used to detect obstacles as
        the TAOUGV is moving. Using a dilation and erosion algorithm, we can
        obtain all obstacle information including distance, width and height in
        front of the TAOUGV on condition of complicated environment. In the
        second step, the terrain adaptive mechanical mechanism with the minimum
        number of wheels can navigate passively through rough terrain, climb
        obstacles actively through a lifting unit, and utilize omni-directional
        motion for avoiding obstacles. Finally, the control module controls the
        central controller to implement mode selection such as passive crossing
        mode, active climbing mode, omni-directional motions, and sensor control
        for hazardous material and toxic gas collection. The simulation and

      abstract: A new reactive collision avoidance method for navigation of aerial
        robots (such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)) in unstructured
        urban/suburban environments is presented. Small form-factor aerial
        robots, such as quadcopters, often have limited payload capacity, flight
        time, processing power, and sensing capabilities. To enhance the
        capabilities of such vehicles without increasing weight or computing
        power, a reactive collision avoidance method based on open sectors is
        described. The method utilizes information from a two-dimensional laser
        scan of the environment and a short-term memory of past actions and can
        rapidly circumvent obstacles in outdoor urban/suburban environments.
        With no map required, the method enables the robot to react quickly and
        navigate even when the enivornment changes. Furthermore, the low
        computational requirement of the method allows the robot to quickly
        react to unknown obstacles that may be poorly represented in the scan,
        such as trees with branches and leaves. The method is validated in
        simulation results and through physical experiments on a prototype
        quadcopter system, where results show the robot flying smoothly around
        obstacles at a relatively high speed (3 m/s).

      abstract: "Rising demand in last-mile delivery has heightened sustainability,
        cost, and delay concerns in traditional logistics. Unmanned Aerial
        Vehicles (UAVs) offer a transformative solution to ground vehicles due
        to their efficiency, low emission, and ability to avoid traffic.
        However, realizing their potential in crowdsourced delivery faces
        fundamental barriers: limited flight time due to highly unpredictable
        energy consumption that varies significantly with flight environment and
        payload. Existing solutions, such as simplified payload-based energy
        models, in-transit recharging, or pairing UAVs with trucks, often
        overlook the effect of flight environment uncertainty and fluctuating
        energy demands. These approaches are typically tailored for structured
        delivery networks, making them unsuitable for crowdsourced systems.
        Moreover, the absence of transparent, accountable frameworks severely
        limits adoption for high-value perishable deliveries and platform
        scalability. This paper presents a comprehensive energy-aware, secure,

        Quality of Delivery (QoD). Digital twins are proposed and modeled for
        transparent and real-time package storage and status monitoring.

      keywords: Robotic weed control, unmanned ground vehicles, specialty crops
      abstract: ABSTRACT Specialty crop herbicides are not a target for herbicide
        discovery programs, and many of these crops do not have access to
        relevant herbicides. High-value fruit and vegetable crops represent high
        potential liability in the case of herbicide-induced crop damage and low
        acres for revenue. Labour shortages and higher manual weeding costs are
        an issue for both conventional and organic specialty crop growers.
        Robotic weeders are promising new weed control tools for specialty crops
        because they are cheaper to develop and, with fewer environmental and
        human health risks, are less regulated than herbicides. However, many of
        the robotic weeders are too expensive for small growers to use. In the
        future, greater investment into robotic weeders for small-scale growers
        will be important. The Clearpath robotics platform Husky may provide a
        cheap and autonomous way to control weeds in small diversified specialty
        crop farms. Being able to work autonomously in multiple soil moisture
        environments is the driving factor behind optimizing the Husky platform
        for weed control. Research has been conducted to evaluate the impact of
        soil moisture and mechanical actuator on mobility and weed control.
        Though weed control was not commercially acceptable in these studies,
        future optimizations to the Husky robotics platform can achieve
        commercial success.

      abstract: The increasing computational power of machines and more affordable
        robotic hardware and software offer great opportunities for developing
        more advanced intelligent robotic systems to perform numerous tasks in
        the civil infrastructure sector (CIS). More specifically, unmanned
        aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are the most
        commonly used robots for civil infrastructure-related applications.
        Existing synthesized information on the applications of UAVs and UGVs
        mainly focused on either a specifically narrow domain or broadly
        summarized the current practices of robots in the CIS without providing
        sufficient information about the relevant sensing devices and/or data
        processing techniques. Therefore, there is a need to widely review,
        synthesize, and analyze the applications of UAVs and UGVs as well as the
        associated methods (e.g., data sensing techniques and data analytic
        methods) in the broad CIS field. To this end, this paper provides a
        systematic review of UAVs- and UGVs-related studies conducted in the CIS
        in relation to their applications, the used robotic platforms, the
        employed sensors, and the implemented algorithms. Following the
        Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
        (PRISMA) methodology (which is a commonly used framework to objectively
        perform systematic literature review) and a total of 95 articles
        identified from 15 purposively selected journals, this paper conducted a
        comprehensive systematic review of the uses of UAVs and UGVs in the CIS.
        Analysis was performed on the information extracted from these articles
        to (1) collect relevant, timely information and synthesize it into a
        cohesive summary of existing knowledge about the applications of UAVs
        and UGVs, (2) synthesize the current robotic platforms, performed tasks,
        major robotic accessories, and onboard sensing devices of UAVs and UGVs,
        (3) investigate existing techniques for sensing data analytics, and (4)
        outline the main challenges and potential opportunities for directing
        future studies and engineering practices in the CIS. While this paper
        serves as an expert reference and guide for both researchers and
        practitioners working in the smart, intelligent, and automated civil
        infrastructure domain, it also identifies the need for additional
        research and efforts to improve the uses of UAVs and UGVs and
        facilitating their developments in the CIS to improve and digitalize the
        built environment.

        platforms, the employed sensors, and the implemented algorithms.
        Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
        Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology (which is a commonly used framework
        to objectively perform systematic literature review) and a total of 95
        articles identified from 15 purposively selected journals, this paper
        conducted a comprehensive systematic review of the uses of UAVs and UGVs
        in the CIS. Analysis was performed on the information extracted from
        these articles to (1) collect relevant, timely information and
        synthesize it into a cohesive summary of existing knowledge about the
        applications of UAVs and UGVs, (2) synthesize the current robotic
        platforms, performed tasks, major robotic accessories, and onboard
        sensing devices of UAVs and UGVs, (3) investigate existing techniques
        for sensing data analytics, and (4) outline the main challenges and
        potential opportunities for directing future studies and engineering
        practices in the CIS. While this paper serves as an expert reference and
        guide for both researchers and practitioners working in the smart,
        intelligent, and automated civil infrastructure domain, it also
        identifies the need for additional research and efforts to improve the
        uses of UAVs and UGVs and facilitating their developments in the CIS to
        improve and digitalize the built environment.}

      abstract: Offshore oil and gas industry has a strong incentive to improve its
        traditional operations and move towards more remote controlled and
        automated installations. This allows for improved efficiency, reduced
        cost and improved quality, and safety by removing personnel out of
        harm's way. The use of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) in these upcoming
        platforms, is relevant for Inspection and Maintenance (I&M) operations.
        Traditionally, UGVs are used only for pre-defined tasks and have no
        capabilities for replanning, if a new task is required or any unexpected
        event occurs. This paper presents a novel concept for I&M operations
        using automated planning for UGVs. The automated planner is based on a
        temporal planning algorithm, and considers actions related to, for
        example, visiting a specific waypoint, inspect a sensor or manipulate an
        actuator. Also, the proposed system allows to perform replanning in case
        of any specific location needs to be revisited or a path is blocked. In
        addition, we couple the mission planner with a UGV guidance, navigation
        and control system, which has path planning, path following and control
        capabilities. To assess the performance of the proposed system, an use
        case for I&M operations on board of an oil and gas platform was
        simulated and promising results were obtained.

      keywords: Natural gas, Pipeline, Surveys, Subsurface, Upstream production,
        Flowlines/gathering lines
      abstract: Pipelines transport natural gas (NG) in all stages between production
        and the end user. The NG composition, pipeline depth, and pressure vary
        significantly between extraction and consumption. As methane (CH4), the
        primary component of NG is both explosive and a potent greenhouse gas,
        NG leaks from underground pipelines pose both a safety and environmental
        threat. Leaks are typically found when an observer detects a CH4
        enhancement as they pass through the downwind above-ground NG plume. The
        likelihood of detecting a plume depends, in part, on the size of the
        plume, which is contingent on both environmental conditions and
        intrinsic characteristics of the leak. To investigate the effects of
        leak characteristics, this study uses controlled NG release experiments
        to observe how the above-ground plume width changes with changes in the
        gas composition of the NG, leak rate, and depth of the subsurface
        emission. Results show that plume width generally decreases when heavier
        hydrocarbons are present, the leak rate is reduced, and as leak depth
        decreases from 0.9 to 0.6 m. The study illustrates that heavy gas leaks
        from flowlines and gathering lines could currently be more challenging
        to detect than leaks from distribution pipelines as the plume is trapped
        close to the ground. Further, this study shows that leaks from pipelines
        laid in covers meeting minimum depth requirements of 0.9 m could be
        easier to detect compared to those buried shallower. Overall, this study
        illustrates that leak survey protocols for flowlines and gathering lines
        should be different from distribution pipelines and tailored to the
        compositions of the transported NG to report emissions accurately. The
        study aims to improve the understanding of flowline/gathering line leaks
        to prevent fatal accidents, such as the 2017 explosion from a gathering
        line in Firestone, Colorado, that resulted in two fatalities and one
        injury.

      abstract: This paper presents a soft trajectory-tracking approach to deal with
        the undesired effect of severe slip conditions. The soft trajectory
        tracking can be interpreted as a relaxation of the desired time
        parameterization of the trajectory when the floor–tire grip is
        significantly reduced. The primary objective is to avoid the
        high-velocity control commands in the scenarios with reduced grip by
        holding the evolution of the desired trajectory. The proposed method is
        only activated if a significant slip condition is verified, which
        preserves the expected navigation performance under standard floor–tire
        conditions. It is formally shown that the proposed soft-tracking
        strategy effectively avoids high wheel velocities while preserving the
        control strategy and the original trajectory planning. The main novelty
        is to mitigate the effect of the tracking error on the control action,
        under significant slippage conditions, such that the velocity is limited
        by the relaxed trajectory. The proposed approach can be combined with
        any error-based trajectory tracking control law. A detailed experimental

        quality monitoring applications such as occupational health and safety
        of (industrial) workplaces. The concept combines a robotic swarm
        composing of nano Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (nano UAVs), based on the
        Crazyflie 2.0 quadrocopter, and small lightweight metal oxide gas
        sensors for measuring the Total Volatile Organic Compound (TVOC) in ppb
        and estimating the eCO2 (equivalent calculated carbon-dioxide)
        concentration in ppm. TVOC is a measure for the indoor air quality. An
        indoor localization and positioning system will be used to estimate the
        absolute 3D position of the swarm like GPS. Based on this novel indoor
        air quality monitoring concept, the development and validation of new
        algorithms in the field of Mobile Robot Olfaction (MRO) are planned,
        namely gas source localization and gas distribution mapping. A test

      abstract: "Advanced leak detection (ALD) solutions for natural gas (NG) play a
        crucial role in swiftly identifying leaks to mitigate risks, costs, and
        methane (CH4) emissions. Despite recent advancements in CH4 leak
        detection, current ALD solutions often overlook the influence of
        subsurface and atmospheric conditions on gas behavior and, therefore,
        leak detection success. To address this gap, we conducted a series of
        controlled leak detection experiments under varying soil moisture levels
        and soil types, with two leak rates: low (0.5 slpm) and high (10 slpm),
        using walking, driving, and simulated UAV (UAVsim) surveys. The
        performance of these methods was evaluated using the probability of
        detection (POD). Results indicated that the POD of walking, driving, and
        UAVsim surveys is highly influenced by soil moisture and type. Low
        moisture conditions have a 10–45 % higher POD than high moisture
        conditions at higher leak rates, depending on the soil type and survey
        method. Higher permeability soils result in a 10–18 % higher POD than
        the lower-permeability soil tested within 5 m of the pipeline
        centerline. As the distance from the centerline increases, the magnitude
        of the impact grows, resulting in PODs 40–60 % lower than those along
        the centerline itself. Similarly, at low leak rates, the impact of high
        moisture and low permeability becomes more pronounced. Based on averages
        across all soil types and survey deployment platforms, the POD under dry
        soil conditions at a high leak rate is 20–40 % higher than at a low leak
        rate. Results further demonstrate the influence of the detection
        threshold, especially for low leak rates, where a 0.1 ppm increase in
        the detection threshold can reduce the POD by 50–60 % under moist soil
        conditions. These findings underscore the importance of considering the
        interplay between soil and operational conditions to enhance CH4 leak
        detection success. Emission measurement solutions can therefore use this
        knowledge to establish performance metrics that account for variations
        in soil conditions."

      abstract: New types of aerial robots (NTARs) have found extensive applications
        in the military, civilian contexts, scientific research, disaster
        management, and various other domains. Compared with traditional aerial
        robots, NTARs exhibit a broader range of morphological diversity,

        attachment as NTARs. Subsequently, this paper discusses the latest
        research progress in the materials and manufacturing technology,
        actuation technology, and perception and control technology of NTARs.
        Thereafter, the research status of NTAR systems is summarized, focusing
        on the frontier development and application cases of flapping-wing
        micro-air vehicles, perching aerial robots, amphibious robots, and
        operational aerial robots. Finally, the main challenges presented by
        NTARs in terms of energy, materials, and perception are analyzed, and
        the future development trends of NTARs are summarized in terms of size
        and endurance, mechatronics, and complex scenarios, providing a

      abstract: Developing a low-power and effective method to achieve long-endurance
        gas sensing sampling for small mobile electronic nose (E-nose) systems
        remains a significant challenge. Traditional gas pumps or free diffusion
        sampling methods are constrained by high power consumption and

        sturgeons, this study presents, for the first time, a zero-power
        bio-inspired gas sensing sampling chamber with sensing response
        enhancement capability. This chamber guides target gases to fully
        contact the sensor surface during movement while effectively reducing
        the negative effects of atmospheric turbulence. Subsequently, its
        significant performance advantages in soil pesticide residue inspection
        applications are demonstrated as an example. Results show that the
        innovative sampling chamber significantly enhances sensitivity (up to
        93.5 % improvement, compared to identical systems without the chamber)
        while reducing power consumption (up to 83.6 % reduction, compared to
        identical systems with the traditional gas pump chamber). Classical
        machine learning algorithms maintain high recognition rate for various
        volatile gases (up to 98.3 %). Finally, numerical simulations verify the
        realization of the expected bionic fluid properties. This work breaks
        through the limitations of traditional mobile E-nose systems, providing
        an important technological innovation for advancing gas inspection.

        (CH4) sensor has been developed to analyze CH4 leakage in the pipeline

        independently-designed miniature optical structure with an optical path
        length of 36 cm are adopted, which greatly reduces the size of the
        sensor. In order to improve the measurement accuracy, a temperature
        compensation link is designed to minimize the influence of temperature

        Bi-directional long short-term memory GKSO-BiLSTM algorithm is used for
        CH4 concentration inversion. The measured and real concentration values
        of the sensor are closely related, with a correlation coefficient (R2)

        technology and navigation systems have made drones a powerful and
        reliable basis for professional data acquisition. Today, the use of UAVs
        has expanded massively in the civil and commercial sectors and this
        technology has found its way into almost every industrial sector
        including the petroleum industry. Drone technology offers a great
        potential to revolutionize the mapping, monitoring, inspection, and
        surveillance procedures of the petroleum industry by providing a faster,
        safer, and more cost-efficient way of mass data collection. This article
        offers a review of the common UAV platforms and sensor systems and
        highlights the state-of-the-art and application examples of drone remote
        sensing in the oil and gas industry. Six broad areas are recognized
        comprising offshore oil spill detection, oil leakage detection, pipeline
        monitoring, gas emission sensing, remote facility inspection, petroleum
        exploration (i.e., land surveying, geologic mapping, and petroleum
        exploration), and environmental monitoring. Research gaps and open
        issues along with opportunities for further developments in each of
        these areas are highlighted.

      abstract: Natural gas pipeline leaks can cause fires or explosions, making quick
        and accurate leak source identification critical for emergency response.
        This study develops a natural gas pipeline leakage source inversion
        model, where a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-Physics-Informed Neural
        Network (POD-PINN) is integrated as the gas forward diffusion model. The
        inversion model combines an improved particle filtering algorithm, gas
        sensor data, and the POD-PINN, enabling rapid identification of leakage
        source terms. The gas source estimation results using POD-PINN and the
        Gaussian model as forward models were compared across different
        scenarios, and the impact of sensor errors on the inversion model was
        analyzed. Using POD-PINN as the forward model preserves accuracy while
        improving computational efficiency. The inclusion of a Gaussian kernel
        function and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method addresses degeneracy
        and impoverishment issues in standard particle filtering, preventing
        convergence to local optima. Results show that, across different
        scenarios, spatial position estimation errors are under 5%, and source
        strength errors are below 8%. When sensor measurement error is exceeds
        0.5, the model cannot accurately estimate all source parameters. The
        proposed inversion model is subjected to convergence analysis,

      abstract: "Small drones with biosensor devices have great potential for
        detecting odorant molecules in air and can be applied to environmental
        and security monitoring. To realize these applications, two important
        factors are considered: first, development of highly sensitive,
        selective, and real-time odorant sensor devices, and second,
        construction of a highly maneuverable platform with efficient odor
        source localization. Previously, small drones with commercial gas
        sensors or biosensors based on insect antennae have been developed.
        However, the performance of gas sensors proved to be inadequate for
        real-time sensing; the flight performance of a bio-hybrid drone was
        limited because the yaw turn was not considered and flight tests were

        autonomous small drone with a portable electroantennogram (EAG) based on
        silkmoth antennae mounted on it. The EAG device was also equipped with a
        sensor enclosure to enhance sensor directivity. The bio-hybrid drone can
        recognize real-time odorant concentration differences in a pseudo-open
        environment (outside the wind tunnel). We also developed an enclosure
        for enhancing the sensor directivity of EAG. Owing to the enclosure, the
        drone could distinguish the front-back direction in the odor plume
        without a wind direction sensor. Based on these results, the drone
        recognized the maximum value of odorant concentration during an over
        360° yaw turn and localized the odor source using the spiral-surge
        algorithm without any assumption of the upwind direction. This study

      abstract: As the deployment of natural gas pipelines expands, leak detection and

        protecting the environment. A natural gas pipeline leak detection
        platform has been developed for complex environments. Infrared images of

      keywords: UAV imagery, Model compression, Quantization, Model optimization, Pruning
      abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool
        for detecting weeds in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery. However,
        the deployment of deep learning models in UAVs intended for onboard
        processing is hindered by their large size, which demands significant
        computational resources. To address these challenges, we applied two
        compression techniques—pruning and quantization—both independently and
        in combination, to assess their effectiveness in reducing model size
        with minimal accuracy loss. Using the DeepLab v3+ model with various
        backbones, including ResNet-18, ResNet-50, MobileNet-v2, and Xception,
        the study systematically investigates these techniques in the context of
        in-field weed detection. We developed a pruning technique that gives
        less important parameters to be reinitialized iteratively before final
        pruning. The importance of each parameter was evaluated using a Taylor
        expansion-based criterion. We fine-tuned the pruned model on the UAV
        dataset to mitigate any performance loss resulting from pruning. We then
        applied quantization to reduce the precision of numerical parameters and
        improve computational efficiency. Pruning alone reduced model size by
        ∼55–65 % with only a 1–3 % accuracy drop, while quantization alone
        achieved ∼35–50 % reduction with slightly higher degradation. Combined,
        they yielded up to 75 % model size reduction while maintaining over 90 %
        accuracy, particularly for ResNet-50 and Xception, which were more
        resilient than MobileNet-v2. Compressed models were tested on NVIDIA
        Jetson AGX Xavier and Jetson AGX Orin, achieving 40.7 % and 52.3 %
        latency reduction respectively. These results confirm the models'
        efficiency and readiness for edge deployment. These results support
        future deployment of efficient, site-specific weed detection on UAVs.
        Future research will focus on deploying the compressed models in actual
        field operations to evaluate their real-time performance and practical
        effectiveness.

        each parameter was evaluated using a Taylor expansion-based criterion.
        We fine-tuned the pruned model on the UAV dataset to mitigate any
        performance loss resulting from pruning. We then applied quantization to
        reduce the precision of numerical parameters and improve computational
        efficiency. Pruning alone reduced model size by ∼55–65 % with only a 1–3
        % accuracy drop, while quantization alone achieved ∼35–50 % reduction
        with slightly higher degradation. Combined, they yielded up to 75 %
        model size reduction while maintaining over 90 % accuracy, particularly
        for ResNet-50 and Xception, which were more resilient than MobileNet-v2.
        Compressed models were tested on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and Jetson AGX
        Orin, achieving 40.7 % and 52.3 % latency reduction respectively. These
        results confirm the models' efficiency and readiness for edge
        deployment. These results support future deployment of efficient,
        site-specific weed detection on UAVs. Future research will focus on
        deploying the compressed models in actual field operations to evaluate
        their real-time performance and practical effectiveness.}

      abstract: Detecting and quantifying subsurface leaks remains a challenge due to
        the complex nature and extent of belowground leak scenarios. To address
        these scenarios, monitoring and evaluating changes in gas leakage
        behavior over space and time are crucial for ensuring safe and efficient
        responses to known or potential gas leaks. This study demonstrates the
        capability of linking environmental and gas concentration data obtained
        using a low-cost, near real-time methane (CH4) detector network and an
        inverse gas migration model to capture and quantify non-steady state
        belowground natural gas (NG) leaks. The Estimating Surface Concentration
        Above Pipeline Emission (ESCAPE) model was modified to incorporate the
        impact of soil properties on gas migration. Field-scale controlled NG
        experiments with leakage rates ranging from 37 to 121 g/h indicate that
        elevated belowground near-surface (BNS) gas concentrations persist long
        before elevated surface concentrations are observed. On average, BNS CH4
        concentrations were 20%–486% higher than surface CH4 concentrations
        within the monitoring radius of 4 m from the leak location. An increase
        in the BNS CH4 concentration was observed within 3 h as the leak rate
        increased from 37 to 89 g/h. However, due to the atmospheric
        fluctuations, any changes in surface CH4 concentrations could not be
        confirmed within this period. The plume area of the BNS CH4 extended
        approximately two times farther than that of the surface CH4 as the gas
        leak rate increased from 37 to 121 g/h. The estimated NG leak rates by
        the modified ESCAPE model agreed well with the experimental NG leak
        rates (m = 0.99 and R2 = 0.77), demonstrating that including soil
        characteristics and BNS CH4 measurements can advance estimations of
        non-steady NG leak rates in low and moderate NG leak rate scenarios. The
        CH4 detector network and model show potential as an innovative tool to
        improve operators' risk assessment and NG leakage response.

      keywords: UAV, CO, Monitoring, Municipal solid waste incineration, Emission

      abstract: The accurate quantification of greenhouse gas emissions from waste
        treatment facilities is critical for effective climate change mitigation
        and regulatory compliance. Measurement-based methods are increasingly
        emphasized as essential for addressing uncertainties in emission
        estimates, with uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) recognized for their
        flexibility and ability to capture spatially resolved data. This study
        evaluated CO2 emissions at a municipal solid waste incinerator using UAV
        monitoring with two quantification methods—the mass balance and inverse
        Gaussian methods. Ground-based wind data introduced significant
        uncertainty in CO2 emission quantification. Therefore, this study
        proposed using a mounted anemometer to capture high-resolution
        spatially-resolved wind data. The performance of the proposed
        quantification methods was assessed by comparing UAV-derived fluxes to
        reference quantification data to calculate errors, which were then
        compared across methods to evaluate accuracy. The mass balance method,
        incorporating spatially-resolved wind data, achieved a mean absolute
        percentage error (MAPE) of 37.34%, which was a marked improvement
        compared to the 64.32% MAPE using spatially-averaged wind data.
        Similarly, the inverse Gaussian method showed a lower MAPE of 46.45%
        using spatially-resolved wind data, compared to 54.97% using spatially
        averaged wind data. Additionally, the advantages of each method under
        varying conditions of wind variability were evaluated. This study
        demonstrates that spatially-resolved wind measurements with a mounted
        anemometer improve the accuracy of CO2 emission calculations. This
        approach highlights the importance of UAV-based monitoring of greenhouse
        gases emitted by waste management facilities.

        abstract = {The accurate quantification of greenhouse gas emissions from
        waste treatment facilities is critical for effective climate change
        mitigation and regulatory compliance. Measurement-based methods are
        increasingly emphasized as essential for addressing uncertainties in
        emission estimates, with uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) recognized for
        their flexibility and ability to capture spatially resolved data. This
        study evaluated CO2 emissions at a municipal solid waste incinerator
        using UAV monitoring with two quantification methods—the mass balance
        and inverse Gaussian methods. Ground-based wind data introduced
        significant uncertainty in CO2 emission quantification. Therefore, this
        study proposed using a mounted anemometer to capture high-resolution
        spatially-resolved wind data. The performance of the proposed
        quantification methods was assessed by comparing UAV-derived fluxes to
        reference quantification data to calculate errors, which were then
        compared across methods to evaluate accuracy. The mass balance method,
        incorporating spatially-resolved wind data, achieved a mean absolute
        percentage error (MAPE) of 37.34%, which was a marked improvement
        compared to the 64.32% MAPE using spatially-averaged wind data.
        Similarly, the inverse Gaussian method showed a lower MAPE of 46.45%
        using spatially-resolved wind data, compared to 54.97% using spatially
        averaged wind data. Additionally, the advantages of each method under
        varying conditions of wind variability were evaluated. This study
        demonstrates that spatially-resolved wind measurements with a mounted
        anemometer improve the accuracy of CO2 emission calculations. This
        approach highlights the importance of UAV-based monitoring of greenhouse
        gases emitted by waste management facilities.}

      abstract: Innovations in precision agriculture enhance complex tasks, reduce

        One of the main challenges is ensuring rapid information availability
        for autonomous vehicles and standardizing processes across platforms to

        communication barriers, high costs, and post-processing requirements

        introduces a standardized data fusion framework for creating real-time
        spatial variability maps using images from different Unmanned Aerial
        Vehicles (UAVs) for Site-Specific Crop Management (SSM). Two spatial
        interpolation methods were used (Inverse Distance Weight, IDW, and
        Triangulated Irregular Networks, TIN), selected for their computational
        efficiency and input flexibility. The proposed framework can use
        different UAV image sources and offers versatility, speed, and
        efficiency, consuming up to 98 % less time, energy, and computing
        requirements than standard photogrammetry techniques, providing rapid
        field information, allowing edge computing incorporation into the UAV

        Finland in 2022 under the H2020 FlexiGroBots project demonstrated a
        strong correlation between results from this method and those from
        standard photogrammetry techniques (up to r = 0.93). In addition, the
        correlation with Sentinel 2 satellite images was as strong as that
        obtained with photogrammetry-based orthomosaics (up to r = 0.8). The
        proposed approach could support irrigation leak detection, soil

      abstract: Incineration is a waste treatment method that involves burning the
        organic components of waste. While this process significantly reduces
        the volume of waste sent to landfills, it also generates environmental
        pollution and poses potential risks to public health. Although volatile
        organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from some combustion processes have
        been studied, VOCs released in the form of aerial plumes from
        incinerator smokestacks have rarely been evaluated. This knowledge gap
        is primarily due to the lack of suitable observation techniques for
        accurately detecting and capturing smokestack plumes. In this study, we
        employed novel drone-based observation and sampling techniques to
        investigate the characteristic VOCs emitted from a waste incineration
        smokestack. Additionally, we analyzed VOC emissions from landfills to
        provide a comparative assessment. Our findings indicate that incinerator
        plumes presented higher proportions of ethane, propane, ethyne, benzene,
        acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, and benzaldehyde, while nonanal and
        decanal originated mainly from landfills. Another species of interest is
        trimethylsilanol (TMSiOH), which has been observed in particularly high
        concentrations in both incinerator plumes and landfill emissions. TMSiOH
        levels from these sources were significantly higher than those detected
        in urban, rural, roadside, and background atmospheric environments,
        highlighting its potential as a characteristic marker of incinerator
        plumes and landfill emissions to identify pollution sources. Overall,
        this study demonstrates that unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based

      keywords: Methane, Enteric EFs, UAV, AirCore, Dairy farm
      abstract: Enteric fermentation and manure methane emissions from livestock are
        major anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. In general, direct
        measurements of farm-scale methane emissions are scarce due to the
        source complexity and the limitations of existing atmospheric sampling
        methods. Using an innovative UAV-based active AirCore system, we have
        performed accurate atmospheric measurements of CH4 mole fractions
        downwind of a dairy cow farm in the Netherlands on four individual days
        during the period from March 2017 to March 2019. The total CH4 emission
        rates from the farm were determined using the UAV-based mass balance
        approach to be 1.1–2.4 g/s. After subtracting estimated emission factors
        of manure onsite, we derived the enteric emission factors to be
        0.20–0.51 kgCH4/AU/d (1 AU = 500 kg animal weight) of dairy cows. We
        show that the uncertainties of the estimates were dominated by the
        variabilities in the wind speed and the angle between the wind and the
        flight transect. Furthermore, nonsimultaneous sampling in the vertical
        direction of the plume is one of the main limiting factors to achieving
        accurate estimate of the CH4 emissions from the farm. In addition, a N2O
        tracer release experiment at the farm was performed when both a UAV and
        a mobile van were present to simultaneously sample the N2O tracer and
        the CH4 plumes from the farm, improving the source quantification with a
        correction factor of 1.04 and 1.22 for the inverse Gaussian approach and
        for the mass balance approach, respectively. The UAV-based active
        AirCore system is capable of providing useful estimates of CH4 emissions
        from dairy cow farms. The uncertainties of the estimates can be improved
        when combined with accurate measurements of local wind speed and
        direction or when combined with a tracer approach.

      abstract: In the ongoing Anthropocene era, air quality monitoring constitutes a
        primary axis of European and international policies for all sectors,
        including Waste Water Treatment Plants (WWTPs). Unmanned Aerial Systems
        (UASs) with proper sensing equipment provide an edge technology for air
        quality and odor monitoring. In addition, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
        photogrammetry has been used in civil engineering, environmental (water)
        quality assessment and lately for industrial facilities monitoring. This
        study constitutes a systematic review of the late advances and
        limitations of germane equipment and implementations. Despite their
        unassailable flexibility and efficiency, the employment of the
        aforementioned technologies in WWTP remote monitoring is yet sparse,
        partial, and concerns only particular aspects. The main finding of the
        review was the lack of a tailored UAS for WWTP monitoring in the
        literature. Therefore, to fill in this gap, we propose a fit-for-purpose
        remote monitoring system consisting of a UAS with a platform that would
        integrate all the required sensors for air quality (i.e., emissions of
        H2S, NH3, NOx, SO2, CH4, CO, CO2, VOCs, and PM) and odor monitoring,
        multispectral and thermal cameras for photogrammetric structural health
        monitoring (SHM) and wastewater/effluent properties (e.g., color,
        temperature, etc.) of a WWTP. It constitutes a novel, supreme and
        integrated approach to improve the sustainable management of WWTPs.
        Specifically, the developments that a fit-for-purpose WWTP UAS would
        launch, are fostering the decision-making of managers, administrations,
        and policymakers, both in operational conditions and in case of
        failures, accidents or natural disasters. Furthermore, it would
        significantly reduce the operational expenditure of a WWTP, ensuring
        personnel and population health standards, and local area
        sustainability.

        abstract = {In the ongoing Anthropocene era, air quality monitoring
        constitutes a primary axis of European and international policies for
        all sectors, including Waste Water Treatment Plants (WWTPs). Unmanned
        Aerial Systems (UASs) with proper sensing equipment provide an edge
        technology for air quality and odor monitoring. In addition, Unmanned
        Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry has been used in civil engineering,
        environmental (water) quality assessment and lately for industrial
        facilities monitoring. This study constitutes a systematic review of the
        late advances and limitations of germane equipment and implementations.
        Despite their unassailable flexibility and efficiency, the employment of
        the aforementioned technologies in WWTP remote monitoring is yet sparse,
        partial, and concerns only particular aspects. The main finding of the
        review was the lack of a tailored UAS for WWTP monitoring in the
        literature. Therefore, to fill in this gap, we propose a fit-for-purpose
        remote monitoring system consisting of a UAS with a platform that would
        integrate all the required sensors for air quality (i.e., emissions of
        H2S, NH3, NOx, SO2, CH4, CO, CO2, VOCs, and PM) and odor monitoring,
        multispectral and thermal cameras for photogrammetric structural health
        monitoring (SHM) and wastewater/effluent properties (e.g., color,
        temperature, etc.) of a WWTP. It constitutes a novel, supreme and
        integrated approach to improve the sustainable management of WWTPs.
        Specifically, the developments that a fit-for-purpose WWTP UAS would
        launch, are fostering the decision-making of managers, administrations,
        and policymakers, both in operational conditions and in case of
        failures, accidents or natural disasters. Furthermore, it would
        significantly reduce the operational expenditure of a WWTP, ensuring
        personnel and population health standards, and local area
        sustainability.}

      abstract: Facade tile shedding poses significant risks to urban safety; however,
        traditional inspection methods often suffer from limited efficiency and
        coverage. Inspired by the recent advancements in unmanned aerial vehicle
        (UAV)-based inspection technologies, this study investigated 111
        high-rise residential buildings in Chengdu, China, to classify facade
        tile defects and identified hollowing as the most critical cause of tile
        shedding. To address this issue, indoor experiments were conducted to
        calibrate UAV-mounted infrared thermography parameters. A temperature
        threshold was integrated with the system of evaluation of facades for
        the rapid detection of hollowing defects. The results showed that
        optimal UAV detection performance is achieved within a linear distance
        of 2–3 m, a vertical declination of −30° to +30°, and a horizontal angle
        of −15° to +15°. Furthermore, detection accuracy was found to be
        collectively influenced by the hollowing area, burial depth, thickness,
        tile colour, and bonding material used. The rotational airflow generated
        by UAV rotor blades accelerated the surface cooling rate of facade tiles
        by approximately 10 %. Subsequently, the outdoor experiment demonstrated
        a 31.4 % increase in the number of identified defects and an at least
        78 % reduction in the inspection time compared with traditional visual
        methods, highlighting the potential efficiency of UAV-based infrared
        thermography in the maintenance and structural health monitoring of

      keywords: DETR, Transformers, Pipe detection, Pipelines, Deep learning, Machine
        learning, Oil and gas
      abstract: Pipelines are essential transportation infrastructure for oil and gas,
        but they are vulnerable to defects such as cracks, joint failure, and
        corrosion due to extreme weather conditions. These defects can result in
        oil and gas leakage, which prompts environmental and economic damages.
        Hence, regular inspection of pipelines is necessary. The industry has
        increasingly relied on using drones for pipeline inspections, though the
        inspection is still done manually by the drone operator or offline via
        recorded video footage from the drone. This paper proposes using the
        Pipe Detection Transformer (P-DETR), a novel transformer-based model
        designed for pipeline detection and potential integration with aerial
        robots or drones to enable autonomous pipeline inspection. P-DETR
        introduces significant improvements to the original Detection
        Transformer (DETR) framework to enhance its detection performance,
        particularly for small-sized pipes - a key limitation of the baseline
        DETR. The major contribution is a Feature Normalization and
        Transformation (FNT) module, which fuses multiple layers of the
        convolutional backbone to provide a focused representation of
        small-sized features before processing by the transformer module.
        Experimental results validate the superiority of P-DETR, achieving an
        overall mAP of 55 %, a 3 AP improvement over DETR, and significantly
        increasing precision for small-sized pipe detection by 8.6 AP (from 1.9
        to 10.5). Additionally, precision improvements for medium- and
        large-sized pipes were 10.8 AP (from 10.8 to 21.6) and 2.2AP (from 64.4
        to 66.6), respectively, with an overall recall of 73.9 %, a 4 AP
        improved performance over DETR. The results from extensive experiments
        highlight the superior performance of the proposed P-DETR model over the
        original DETR, UP-DETR, R-DETR, Skip-DETR, and other standard object
        detection models, including YOLOv3 and SSD.

      abstract: This paper introduces the Mermoz simulator, developed to predict the
        photovoltaic energy contribution of solar cells mounted on a
        low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) over long-distance flights.
        This MATLAB-based tool implements a modular model of the UAV and its
        environment from an energy-focused perspective. Leveraging 20 years of
        data from the NASA Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource Weather
        Database, the simulator provides an estimate of the confidence interval
        for solar and wind energy contributions expressed in Wh, or, to
        facilitate comparisons, in earned kilometers. Its modular design enables
        easy testing and comparison of various configurations and flight
        strategies (e.g., optimal departure times, autonomy gains, or cruise
        speeds). To facilitate understanding, the structure and operation of the
        simulator are illustrated using the Mermoz drone as a case study. The
        Mermoz UAV features a 4 m wingspan and is powered by an electric
        propulsion system. It combines a fuel cell with a liquid hydrogen tank,
        enabling fully electric, greenhouse gas-free flight. Simulation results
        indicate that wing-mounted solar cells can provide up to 5% additional
        electrical energy during a transatlantic flight.

      abstract: We demonstrate record fast horizontal radial plume mapping (HRPM) of
        nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, enabled by a quantum-cascade laser (QCL)
        and an open-path direct absorption spectroscopy operating around the
        4.5 μm wavelength. The high signal-to-noise ratio of the system yields
        an atmospheric N2O sensor with a remarkable sensitivity of 25 ppt at
        1 Hz update rate as assessed through Allan deviation analysis. The
        excellent sensitivity translates into significantly increased
        measurement rates (0.2−2 kHz) of column-integrated N2O concentrations.
        This is complemented by swift horizontal beam-scanning to multiple
        reflectors positioned in a 4 × 4 grid over a 735 m2 probed area.
        Consequently, we achieve HRPM over the probed area with scan times as
        short as 9 s, marking a substantial 60-fold improvement compared to a
        recent benchmark in the field. The exceptional data update rate of our
        QCL based sensor, coupled with the rapid beam-scanning capabilities,
        lays the foundation for real-time generation of HRPM tomographic maps of
        gas concentration with scan cycles on the order of 1 s. This presents a
        powerful tool for expedited gas leak source localization, as well as
        understanding the spatial dynamics of area source emissions.

      abstract: Chemical process plants require frequent inspection to ensure
        operational safety and prevent equipment failure. In recent years, the
        use of UAVs for inspecting chemical process plants has gained
        significant attention due to their ability to provide more efficient,
        cost-effective, and safer inspection services. This review article
        provides a comprehensive analysis of the current practice and future
        directions of UAV-based inspection in chemical process plants, with a
        focus on the regulatory, technical, and safety considerations. The
        review searched for studies on UAV standards in chemical process plants
        using multiple databases and specific keywords. Two stages of search
        were conducted, including a full-text review, and inclusion and
        exclusion criteria were applied to select relevant studies published in
        English between 2013 and 2023. Data on UAV standards were extracted,
        including benefits, limitations, national as well as international
        standards, challenges, and opportunities. A narrative synthesis approach
        was used to summarize the findings of the studies in a descriptive
        manner. The implications of this review are significant, as they provide
        a comprehensive understanding of the benefits and limitations of using
        UAVs for inspection in chemical process plants. The review highlights
        the need for continued research and development in this area to address
        technical and safety challenges and to facilitate wider adoption of
        UAV-based inspection technologies in chemical process plants.

      abstract: One challenge associated with navigating a nano aerial robot swarm
        indoors in unstructured environments is, i.a., the limited air space. To
        avoid an over-regulation of the available indoor air space (e.g.,
        prohibit copters to fly above each other), a safety region around each
        copter must be defined. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the
        downwash of a nano-drone on the stability of another nearby nano-drone.
        In the experiments, we found out that this downwash has a negative
        influence of a second nano-drone in a distance of around 1 m vertically
        and 0.2 m horizontally. Based on the obtained data, we developed a model
        describing the above-mentioned safety region to enable a safe operation
        of the swarm in these environments with fewer constraints.

        need to develop monitoring methods for UGS and their attributes. One
        example is the estimation of Aboveground biomass (AGB) using Airborne
        laser scanning (ALS) and UAV photogrammetry, which are applied to
        measure attributes of urban vegetation from three-dimensional (3D) point
        clouds. The aim of this study is to examine and compare the use of ALS
        and drone photogrammetry with allometric models to estimate the AGB of
        urban trees on a neighbourhood-level city area. 3D point clouds
        generated by means of ALS and UAV photogrammetry were used to study a
        residential area located in Helsinki, Finland. The point clouds were
        classified and automatic Individual tree detection (ITDauto) method was
        utilized to extract urban trees. In-situ measurements were conducted to
        estimate DBH and assess the accuracy of the tree detection.
        Species-specific and generic allometric models were used to determine
        the AGB of urban vegetation.ITDauto results revealed an overestimation
        of detected trees from both datasets, and differences in DBH, tree
        height, and volume were observed in both datasets. Notably, AGB
        estimation results indicated that species-specific models showed a lower
        estimation compared to generic allometric models. Overall, the results
        suggested that ALS and UAV photogrammetry can be used for mapping
        biomass in urban residential areas, as both methods are cost-effective
        and time-efficient. However, future research should focus on monitoring
        low vegetation types such as shrubs and estimating the biomass as
        existing methods are specific for certain tree species and not suitable
        for broader vegetation types beyond individual trees.

      keywords: Volcanic plume, Photogrammetry, UAV, Yasur volcano
      abstract: As a precise volume of volcanic ash-plume is essential to understand
        the dynamic of gas emission, exchanges and the eruptive dynamics, we
        have measured in 3D using photogrammetry a small-size volcanic plume at
        the summit of Yasur Volcano, Vanuatu. The objective was to collect the
        altitude and planform shape of the plume as well as the vertical
        variations of the shape and size. To reach this objective, the authors
        have used the Structure from Motion photogrammetric method applied to a
        series of photographs captured in a very short period of time around and
        above the plume. A total of 146 photographs at 3000×4000 pixel were
        collected as well as the geolocation, the pitch, tilt and orientation of
        the cameras. The results revealed a "mushroom"-like shape of the plume
        with a narrow ascending column topped by a turbulent mixing zone. The
        volume of the plume was calculated to be ~13,430m3±512m3 (with the error
        being the cube of the linear error from the Ground Control Points) for a
        maximum height above the terrain of 63m. The included error was also
        kept high because of the irregular distribution of the Ground Control
        Points that could not be collected in dangerous areas due to the ongoing
        eruption. Based on this research, it is therefore worth investigating
        the usage of multiple cameras to capture plumes in 3D over time and the
        method is also a good complement to the recent development of
        photogrammetry from space, which can tackle larger-scale eruption
        plumes.

      abstract: "Locating the odor source in an outdoor building environment using
        autonomous vehicles poses a considerable challenge. To address these
        challenges, researchers have explored the employment of a fleet of
        unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for odor source localization (OSL). UAVs
        provide mobility and adaptability, making them a perfect tool for
        reaching remoteor hazardous areas. However, optimizing the flight paths
        of a fleet of UAVs to efficiently explore and locate odor sources in
        dynamic outdoor environments is a complex problem. In this study, a
        novel distributed cooperative control framework was proposed to track
        and effectively explore the odor source. The framework comprises of two
        layers: the fleet layer and the control layer. The UAVs in the fleet
        layer cooperate with one another to share information and set waypoints
        through the concept of particle swarm optimization (PSO). The waypoints
        generated in the fleet layer serve as guidance for the UAVs in the
        control layer, where the perturbation-based extremum seeking control
        (ESC) is employed to navigate the UAVs towards the odor source. The
        proposed framework was proved to be stable and ensures steady
        convergence to the optimum position. Additionally, in order to create a
        very realistic outdoor environment and utilize a fleet of UAVs for 3-D
        OSL, the GADEN simulator was integrated with the ROS-Gazebo system to
        build a simulation platform called Gazebo-GADEN. The performance of the
        proposed framework was evaluated by comparing it with two benchmark
        approaches, perturbation-based extremum ESC and standard PSO. On the one
        hand, the two benchmark approaches may struggle to adapt to the dynamic
        and uncertain nature of outdoor environments. On the other hand, the
        proposed framework approach demonstrates remarkable adaptability to the
        dynamic environment and outperforms the two benchmark approaches in
        terms of searching time and success rate."

        abstract = {Locating the odor source in an outdoor building environment
        using autonomous vehicles poses a considerable challenge. To address
        these challenges, researchers have explored the employment of a fleet of
        unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for odor source localization (OSL). UAVs
        provide mobility and adaptability, making them a perfect tool for
        reaching remoteor hazardous areas. However, optimizing the flight paths
        of a fleet of UAVs to efficiently explore and locate odor sources in
        dynamic outdoor environments is a complex problem. In this study, a
        novel distributed cooperative control framework was proposed to track
        and effectively explore the odor source. The framework comprises of two
        layers: the fleet layer and the control layer. The UAVs in the fleet
        layer cooperate with one another to share information and set waypoints
        through the concept of particle swarm optimization (PSO). The waypoints
        generated in the fleet layer serve as guidance for the UAVs in the
        control layer, where the perturbation-based extremum seeking control
        (ESC) is employed to navigate the UAVs towards the odor source. The
        proposed framework was proved to be stable and ensures steady
        convergence to the optimum position. Additionally, in order to create a
        very realistic outdoor environment and utilize a fleet of UAVs for 3-D
        OSL, the GADEN simulator was integrated with the ROS-Gazebo system to
        build a simulation platform called Gazebo-GADEN. The performance of the
        proposed framework was evaluated by comparing it with two benchmark
        approaches, perturbation-based extremum ESC and standard PSO. On the one
        hand, the two benchmark approaches may struggle to adapt to the dynamic
        and uncertain nature of outdoor environments. On the other hand, the
        proposed framework approach demonstrates remarkable adaptability to the
        dynamic environment and outperforms the two benchmark approaches in
        terms of searching time and success rate.}

      abstract: A new reactive collision avoidance method for navigation of aerial
        robots (such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)) in unstructured
        urban/suburban environments is presented. Small form-factor aerial
        robots, such as quadcopters, often have limited payload capacity, flight
        time, processing power, and sensing capabilities. To enhance the
        capabilities of such vehicles without increasing weight or computing
        power, a reactive collision avoidance method based on open sectors is
        described. The method utilizes information from a two-dimensional laser
        scan of the environment and a short-term memory of past actions and can
        rapidly circumvent obstacles in outdoor urban/suburban environments.
        With no map required, the method enables the robot to react quickly and
        navigate even when the enivornment changes. Furthermore, the low
        computational requirement of the method allows the robot to quickly
        react to unknown obstacles that may be poorly represented in the scan,
        such as trees with branches and leaves. The method is validated in
        simulation results and through physical experiments on a prototype
        quadcopter system, where results show the robot flying smoothly around
        obstacles at a relatively high speed (3 m/s).

      keywords: LIDAR, laser, UAV, energy network, energy distribution, fault detection
      abstract: Energy distribution networks are subject to various problems resulting
        in uncontrolled environmental releases or leaks. These leaks are of
        particular concerns due to the hazardous nature of the transported
        commodity. Consequently, a significant research interest lies in the
        design of effective leak detection technologies. Light Detection and
        Ranging (LIDAR) systems are very promising as they enable remote
        detection at considerable distances. This paper presents an innovative
        LIDAR measurement system capable of detecting leaks from Unmanned Aerial
        Vehicles (UAV). The transmitter consists of a tuneable laser source
        mounted on the UAV and the receiver consists of a calibrated reflector
        and a passive imaging system mounted on an unmanned ground vehicle. This
        bistatic layout allows for a significant increase in range. The system
        employs an open-path Differential Absorption LIDAR (DIAL) measurement
        technique for selected molecular species. The proposed bistatic LIDAR
        system offers notable advantages compared to monostatic DIAL and in situ
        leak detection systems based on extraction sampling technology.

      abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) technology is rapidly advancing,
        offering innovative solutions for various industries, including the
        critical task of oil and gas pipeline surveillance. However, the limited
        flight time of conventional UAVs presents a significant challenge to
        comprehensive and continuous monitoring, which is crucial for
        maintaining the integrity of pipeline infrastructure. This review paper
        evaluates methods for extending UAV flight endurance, focusing on their
        potential application in pipeline inspection. Through an extensive
        literature review, this study identifies the latest advancements in UAV
        technology, evaluates their effectiveness, and highlights the existing
        gaps in achieving prolonged flight operations. Advanced techniques,
        including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep
        learning (DL), are reviewed for their roles in pipeline monitoring.
        Notably, DL algorithms like You Only Look Once (YOLO) are explored for
        autonomous flight in UAV-based inspections, real-time defect detection,
        such as cracks, corrosion, and leaks, enhancing reliability and
        accuracy. A vital aspect of this research is the proposed deployment of
        a hybrid drone design combining lighter-than-air (LTA) and
        heavier-than-air (HTA) principles, achieving a balance of endurance and
        maneuverability. LTA vehicles utilize buoyancy to reduce energy
        consumption, thereby extending flight durations. The paper details the

        abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) technology is rapidly
        advancing, offering innovative solutions for various industries,
        including the critical task of oil and gas pipeline surveillance.
        However, the limited flight time of conventional UAVs presents a
        significant challenge to comprehensive and continuous monitoring, which
        is crucial for maintaining the integrity of pipeline infrastructure.
        This review paper evaluates methods for extending UAV flight endurance,
        focusing on their potential application in pipeline inspection. Through
        an extensive literature review, this study identifies the latest
        advancements in UAV technology, evaluates their effectiveness, and
        highlights the existing gaps in achieving prolonged flight operations.
        Advanced techniques, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine
        learning (ML), and deep learning (DL), are reviewed for their roles in
        pipeline monitoring. Notably, DL algorithms like You Only Look Once
        (YOLO) are explored for autonomous flight in UAV-based inspections,
        real-time defect detection, such as cracks, corrosion, and leaks,
        enhancing reliability and accuracy. A vital aspect of this research is
        the proposed deployment of a hybrid drone design combining
        lighter-than-air (LTA) and heavier-than-air (HTA) principles, achieving
        a balance of endurance and maneuverability. LTA vehicles utilize
        buoyancy to reduce energy consumption, thereby extending flight
        durations. The paper details the methodology for designing LTA vehicles,
        presenting an analysis of design parameters that align with the
        requirements for effective pipeline surveillance. The ongoing work is
        currently at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4, where key components

      abstract: Advanced pipeline leak detection and localization techniques are
        needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from hydrocarbon
        transportation pipelines. Developing effective leak detection and
        localization methods is challenging due to the spatiotemporal dynamics
        of process variables, the presence of process/measurement disturbances
        and constraints, and the limited measurement data. To address this
        issue, this manuscript proposes a novel moving horizon estimation design
        for pipeline leak detection, constrained estimation of leak size and
        location by using an infinite-dimensional pipeline hydraulic model.
        Based on the mass and momentum balance laws and the Cayley–Tustin
        time-discretization method, an infinite-dimensional discrete-time
        pipeline hydraulic model is proposed considering (unknown but bounded)
        disturbance and leak. By introducing a coordinate transformation, we
        decouple the leak size and location estimation problems. The
        implementable discrete-time moving horizon estimator and observer are
        designed for constrained leak size and location estimation. The
        effectiveness of the proposed designs is validated via simulation
        examples.

      abstract: The urgency of the global climate crisis necessitates advanced
        monitoring of greenhouse gases, with an emphasis on capturing their
        spatial and temporal variability. This study explores techniques to
        enhance plume detection and concentration measurements using uncrewed
        aerial vehicles (UAVs) for monitoring at point sources, specifically at
        an incineration stack. Through preliminary site investigations, our
        approach employed strategically designed flight paths and an autopilot
        system to optimize flight operations within the constraints of limited
        flight time due to battery capacity. We combined a UAV-mounted
        anemometer with a plume rise model to localize the plume center at a
        distance of 30 m from the stack center and evaluated its performance by
        comparing the model-based estimations at different altitudes and angular
        directions with the observation results. The comparison demonstrated
        that the results obtained by localizing the plume center using a plume
        rise model and a UAV-mounted anemometer aligned well with observations
        based on CO2 concentration analysis. The comparative analysis showed a
        RMSE of 8.44 m and a MAE of 7.26 m for altitude, and a RMSE of 32.31∘
        and a MAE of 25.78∘ for angular direction. Furthermore, we assessed the
        effectiveness of hovering UAV flights, in which a UAV remains stationary
        at a fixed point in the air, compared to non-hovering flights in
        capturing pollutant concentration. While both methods performed
        similarly in detecting the plume center, non-hovering flights
        underestimated the CO2 concentration due to insufficient time for
        measurement despite a sensor response time of less than three seconds.
        Overall, our proposed hybrid monitoring strategy integrates non-hovering
        and hovering flights, enhancing both plume detection efficiency and
        concentration measurement accuracy at point sources.

      abstract: Pipeline pressure monitoring has been the traditional and most popular
        leak detection approach, however, the delays with leak detection and
        localization coupled with the large number of false alarms led to the
        development of other sensor-based detection technologies. The Real Time
        Transient Model (RTTM) currently has the best performance metric, but it
        requires collection and analysis of large data volume which, in turn,
        has an impact in the detection speed. Several data mining (DM) methods
        have been used for leak detection algorithm development with each having
        its own advantages and shortcomings. Mathematical modelling is used for
        the generation of simulation data and this data is used to train the
        leak detection and localization models. Mathematical models and

        with experimental data with very high levels of accuracy. While the ANN

      abstract: This article investigates the problem of deploying a swarm of UAVs
        equipped with gas sensors for industrial remote gas-plume sensing. This
        setup’s objective is to continuously adjust the swarm formation to
        maximize the combined perception for the dynamically evolved plume’s
        cloud, focusing around areas with the highest concentration/intensity.
        Initially, such a setup is formulated into an optimization problem, the
        solution of which could be acquired by the maximization of an
        appropriately defined objective function. Due to the model-free
        approach, this objective function’s analytical form is not available,
        prohibiting standard gradient descent methodologies. To this end, a
        tracking algorithm is developed and studied, which operates in a
        distributed manner and enables the UAV swarm to build a common consensus
        dynamically, during the evolution of the leakage phenomenon. The overall
        performance is tested in a simulative yet realistic environment using
        ANSYS Fluent suite, considering a simultaneous gas-leak incident at two
        different points. Aside from the standalone evaluation study, the
        proposed gas-plume tracking scheme is able to outperform a
        state-of-the-art alternative algorithm, namely Efficient Global
        Optimization (EGO), in various simulation setups, deploying a different
        number of UAVs on the field.

      keywords: Air quality monitoring, Cloud server, UAV, IoT, Industry 5.0,

      abstract: Air quality defines the condition of the air within the environment.
        However, the quality of the air is deteriorating due to the emission of
        pollutants from vehicles, industries, and landfill sites. Concerning the
        landfill scenario, it is a challenge for a human to monitor the air
        quality continuously due to the emission of stinky smells and gases from
        the landfill sites. In this study, we implement a UAV network based on
        IoT (Internet of Things) and a cloud server for the smart city for
        tracking the air quality of the landfill sites in real-time and alerting
        the UAV for capturing the visuals from the camera for detecting the
        exact cause of the pollutant in the landfill sites. The gas that causes
        the most air pollution is Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Volatile Organic
        Compounds (VOC), Carbon monoxide (CO), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), Ozone,
        dioxins and furans, etc. In this paper, continuous monitoring of these
        harmful gases is done to alert the people to protect them from harm. The
        study is also carrying the discussion about the industry 5.0
        perspectives using UAV long-range communication. The objective of this
        study is to record the sensory data and visuals of the various gases
        (NO2, VOC, CO2, SO2) of landfill sites using IoT & UAV and then
        visualized in a graphical user interface form. The concentration of each
        gas that is stored in the cloud server is presented in the graphical
        representation. Different parameters such as Eigenvalues, Correlation
        Coefficients, and Regression Parameter have also been analysed
        graphically for the recorded data. The visuals captured from the UAV
        camera are employed for estimating the cause of the rise in pollutants
        in landfill sites.

      abstract: Periodic non-destructive testing (NDT) of pipes and tanks is vital in
        industrial plants, such as Oil & Gas facilities, to proactively detect
        defects and corrosion before leaks and forced shutdowns occur. This
        paper presents a hybrid system, consisting of a UAV and a crawler, which
        enables detailed contact-based inspection of elevated pipes, in pursuit
        of eliminating the need for dangerous scaffolding and manual inspection
        to improve safety and reduce cost. Similar to avian animals, the UAV
        autonomously perches on the pipe to conserve energy. A small inspection
        crawling robot is carried by the UAV, and is subsequently released onto
        the pipe’s surface to inspect its health. The crawler uses magnetic
        wheels for agile mobility and houses an ultrasonic testing (UT) sensor
        to thoroughly scan the pipe and detect wall thinning, which is a
        precursor for leaks. Finally, the crawler re-docks with the UAV, which
        in turn detaches from the pipe to fly back home or inspect another pipe.
        The multi-robot system is designed for and tested on pipe diameters as
        small as 8 in.

      abstract: Implementing Networked Aerial Robot Teams (NARTs), such as Unmanned
        Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms and UAV-based networks, is a
        multidisciplinary scientific topic with several high-value contributions
        from distinct backgrounds. Such complex systems contain several
        components, such as communication protocols, swarm coordination
        algorithms, sensor integration and mission planning strategies.
        Developing and deploying NARTs in real-world environments often requires
        balancing these components, which can result in focusing on specific
        aspects while simplifying others. The large diversity of current
        contributions in this area and the constant performance improvements are
        bringing us closer to realising intelligent, efficient, secure,
        reliable, and adaptable aerial robot networks. Therefore, a
        comprehensive, unified analysis can help frame recent literature and
        draw important conclusions for the future improvement of these systems.
        This paper proposes a novel framework for NART literature classification
        based on communication and motion coordination awareness criteria. This
        framework is then used to perform an extensive survey, analysis and
        categorisation of the state of the art of NARTs . On one hand, over 50%
        of the categorised works presented enough awareness to enable the
        implementation of dynamic procedures regarding Communication (63%) and
        Motion Coordination (54%). On another hand, only 17% of the analysed
        works presented the highest level of awareness in one of the NART
        components. Future research challenges regarding the integration of
        these two components will also be identified.

        and directions. The models were trained using different values of

        greater values of timesteps, and good generalisation with test accuracy

      abstract: Methane (CH4) is the second greenhouse gas and has a profound impact
        on global climate change due to its high global warming potential and
        concentration. By 2022, the CH4 concentration was approximately 1.9 ppm,
        which was 264% of the pre-industrial level. The spatiotemporal
        distribution of CH4 was investigated by a portable CH4 detector on an
        unmanned aerial vehicle and electric bicycles in Shaoxing, a city
        situated in the Yangtze River Delta, China. The vertical distribution
        revealed CH4 concentration generally decreased slowly with height.
        However, the inversion condition and low atmospheric boundary layer
        height (ABLH) leaded to the enhancement of CH4 with height. The highest
        CH4 concentration (2.2 ± 0.1 ppm, n = 1428) was observed in winter and
        the lowest (2.0 ± 0.2 ppm, n = 1530) in spring. Regarding the daily
        variation, CH4 concentration peaked at 5:00 local time (LT) and reached
        its lowest level at 14:00 LT, which was attributed to the daily
        variation of ABLH, lowest in the early morning and highest in the noon.
        In urban areas, CH4 concentrations showed higher levels near
        restaurants, natural gas stations and sewerage well, with a maximum
        value of 13.1 ppm, which was caused by CH4 emission and natural gas
        leakage from these places. The annual CH4 emission in Shaoxing were
        estimated to be approximately 69 ton/(km2·year) by the mass balance
        approach. Compared with other cities in the world, the CH4 emission is
        in higher level which imply some control measures should be conducted to
        reduce CH4 emission in Shaoxing.

      keywords: Hyperspectral remote sensing, Unmanned aerial vehicle, Marine oil
        spill, Oil thickness estimation, Spill monitoring
      abstract: Remote sensing plays a crucial role in the detection and monitoring of
        oil spills at sea, aiding in emergency response planning and monitoring
        routines. Despite significant progress in this field, estimating oil
        thickness remains challenging, impacting response efficacy and liability
        determination. Traditional methods like the Bonn Agreement Oil
        Appearance Code (BAOAC) are commonly used operationally. However,
        interpretation based only on visual identification suffers from
        subjectivity and limitations in the code designation for oil films.
        Hyperspectral sensing offers a promising solution for this matter.
        Previous works have demonstrated a relationship between oil spectral
        features and oil thickness. However, most of these studies rely on
        mathematical models validated with aerial or orbital data from old
        spills, hindering real-time applicability. This study proposes a novel
        approach based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with a
        hyperspectral camera for real-time data acquisition during offshore
        spills. The goal was to improve the BAOAC approach by integrating
        VNIR-SWIR spectral data with visual interpretation to classify oil
        spills. The methodology evaluates surface area, oil thickness, and
        weathering stage estimation through a realistic 11-week oil spill
        experiment. Results demonstrate that the high resolution of data
        acquired with UAVs can facilitate close-range monitoring of oil spills,

        abstract = {Remote sensing plays a crucial role in the detection and
        monitoring of oil spills at sea, aiding in emergency response planning
        and monitoring routines. Despite significant progress in this field,
        estimating oil thickness remains challenging, impacting response
        efficacy and liability determination. Traditional methods like the Bonn
        Agreement Oil Appearance Code (BAOAC) are commonly used operationally.
        However, interpretation based only on visual identification suffers from
        subjectivity and limitations in the code designation for oil films.
        Hyperspectral sensing offers a promising solution for this matter.
        Previous works have demonstrated a relationship between oil spectral
        features and oil thickness. However, most of these studies rely on
        mathematical models validated with aerial or orbital data from old
        spills, hindering real-time applicability. This study proposes a novel
        approach based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with a
        hyperspectral camera for real-time data acquisition during offshore
        spills. The goal was to improve the BAOAC approach by integrating
        VNIR-SWIR spectral data with visual interpretation to classify oil
        spills. The methodology evaluates surface area, oil thickness, and
        weathering stage estimation through a realistic 11-week oil spill
        experiment. Results demonstrate that the high resolution of data
        acquired with UAVs can facilitate close-range monitoring of oil spills,
        especially near oil rigs and shorelines, providing more reliable results
        when combined with the BAOAC. The methodology can be upscaled by
        mounting the hyperspectral camera on aircraft or helicopters, providing
        promising applications for oil spill monitoring and offering practical
        insights for the short- and long-term management efforts carried out in

      abstract: This paper presents the design and development of an aerial-ground
        robotics testbed for simulating bimanual manipulation operations on
        orbit relying on aerial robotics platforms, considering as
        representative use case the capture and maintenance of a non-cooperative
        free-floating satellite. The proposed testbed design is intended to
        facilitate the realization of simulations involving physical
        interaction, taking benefit of the technologies derived from aerial
        robotic manipulation, to be used as a complementary or alternative
        solution to existing ground testbed facilities. The system consists of a
        fully actuated multi-rotor (FAMR) that emulates the free flying/free
        floating dynamics of a target satellite, and a lightweight and compliant
        anthropomorphic dual arm system (LiCAS) to conduct the manipulation
        task, implementing the dynamics simulation in Simscape Multibody. The
        human-size and human-like kinematics of the LiCAS allow to replicate the
        manipulation skills of human operators, whereas its very low weight (2.5
        kg) makes it possible to mount it on lightweight industrial robotic arms
        used to reproduce the spacecraft motion. Two types of compliant
        interactions are considered. On the one hand, impedance control for the
        post-contact phase is implemented in the simulation layer, using the
        right arm to hold the target and maintain the relative pose with the
        base while the left arm conducts the manipulation task. On the other
        hand, collision detection and passive accommodation is evaluated in the
        physical testing system relying on the mechanical joint compliance of
        the LiCAS dual arm. Collision reflexes between the free-floating FAMR
        and the compliant arm will be also experimentally evaluated by applying
        the principle of momentum conservation on the multi-rotor. The proposed
        approach takes benefit of the similarities between space and aerial
        robotic manipulation in terms of dynamic modeling, presenting simulation
        and experimental results in an indoor testbed to validate the developed

      keywords: Maritime monitoring, Vessel emission, UAV (Unmanned aerial vehicle),

      abstract: Monitoring the gas emission of maritime vessels is very challenging as
        the fields are almost inaccessible and the emission is very susceptible
        to the surrounding environment. In ultra-large-scale maritime scenes,
        mobile robots capable of gas detection and tracking will most likely
        fall into atmospheric turbulence. In this work, an enhanced tracking
        algorithm using our unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) gas sensor system is
        proposed for maritime vessel emission monitoring. A global prediction is
        acquired by modelling the emission of individual vessel, while another
        local gradient direction can be calculated from the real-time onboard
        sensor measurements. By a probabilistic framework, the global prediction
        and the gradient detection are fused to generate a more reliable
        navigation for the UAV. In order to verify the proposed algorithm, real
        monitoring experiments using the developed UAV gas sensor system are
        presented and SO2, NOx contents in vessel emissions are conducted. A
        comparison between the UAV-based detections and the off-line sampled
        data is preformed, and the results indicate that the proposed algorithm
        has the advantage in exactly guiding the UAV towards the vessel
        emission.

      abstract: Gas Distribution Mapping (GDM) is a valuable tool for monitoring the
        distribution of gases in a wide range of applications, including
        environmental monitoring, emergency response, and industrial safety.
        While GDM is actively researched in the scope of gas-sensitive mobile
        robots (Mobile Robot Olfaction), there is a potential for broader
        applications utilizing sensor networks. This study aims to address the
        lack of deep learning approaches in GDM and explore their potential for
        improved mapping of gas distributions. In this paper, we introduce Gas
        Distribution Decoder (GDD), a learning-based GDM method. GDD is a deep
        neural network for spatial interpolation between sparsely distributed
        sensor measurements that was trained on an extensive data set of
        realistic-shaped synthetic gas plumes based on actual airflow
        measurements. As access to ground truth representations of gas
        distributions remains a challenge in GDM research, we make our data
        sets, along with our models, publicly available. We test and compare GDD
        with state-of-the-art models on synthetic and real-world data. Our
        findings demonstrate that GDD significantly outperforms existing models,
        demonstrating a 35% improvement in accuracy on synthetic data when
        measured using the Root Mean Squared Error over the entire distribution
        map. Notably, GDD appears to have superior capabilities in
        reconstructing the edges and characteristic shapes of gas plumes
        compared to traditional models. These potentials offer new possibilities
        for more accurate and efficient environmental monitoring, and we hope to
        inspire other researchers to explore learning-based GDM.

      abstract: This paper presents first advances in the area of aerial chemical
        trail following. For that purpose, we equipped a palm-size aerial robot,
        based on the Crazyflie 2.0 quadrocopter, with a small lightweight metal
        oxide gas sensor for measuring evaporated ethanol from chemical trails.
        To detect and localize a 5 cm wide chemical trail, a detection criterion
        was developed that uses only relative changes in the transient phase of
        the sensor response. The reduction in signal strength dependence
        improves the robustness of its application. We tested our setup in first
        crossing-trail experiments showing that our flying ant robot can
        correlate an odor hit with the chemical trail within 0.14 m.
        Principally, this could enable aerial chemical trail following in the
        future.

      abstract: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from wastewater treatment plants
        (WWTPs) are increasingly recognized as significant contributors to
        anthropogenic climate change, primarily through the release of methane
        (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2). Current research
        on GHG quantification in WWTPs predominantly relies on estimated
        emission factors. However, this introduces substantial uncertainties in
        emission estimates due to limited in situ measurements and variability
        in quantification methods. Here we review advances in GHG measurement
        techniques, integrating literature data with our in situ studies. We
        show that unit-based methods, such as flux chambers and optical gas
        imaging, pinpoint emission hotspots in individual processes, while
        plant-integrated approaches—like tracer gas dispersion, mobile
        laboratories and aerial surveys—deliver comprehensive plant-scale
        estimates. These techniques reveal wide variability in emissions, with
        CH4 rates spanning 0.04–427 kg h−1 and N2O up to 22.1 kg h−1, but most
        studies are short-term, gas-specific and neglect fossil CO2, which can
        inflate IPCC inventories by up to 22.8 % upon inclusion. Technology- and
        plant-specific emission factors, calibrated via on-site data, markedly
        enhance accuracy by accounting for local factors like treatment
        processes and influent composition. We call for national emission
        inventories via long-term, multi-gas measurements, guiding targeted
        mitigation strategies and transforming WWTPs toward carbon-neutral,
        climate-smart infrastructures.

      abstract: Landfill methane emissions are commonly estimated using cover-type
        dependent default collection efficiency values, with a first-order decay
        model or measured gas collection. Current default collection
        efficiencies used in the United States were predominately derived from 4
        studies conducted during or prior to 2007 that relied on flux chambers.
        Flux chambers are limited by small sample sizes, placement restrictions,
        and the inability to measure emissions from gas or leachate collection
        systems. Since 2007, over 14 new studies have been completed using more
        advanced technologies that allow for direct measurement of methane
        plumes from most or all of a landfill’s surface. On average, these
        measurements are 2–3 times greater than emissions predicted by current
        models and collection efficiency defaults. In lieu of measuring
        emissions from all landfills, updating collection efficiency defaults
        can bring modeled emissions into better alignment with measurements. To
        this end, collection efficiency estimates derived from measured data
        were categorized into cover types and then adjusted to account for cases
        where whole plume measurement was an amalgamation of multiple cover
        types. The resultant adjusted default values were 41% for daily cover,
        69% for intermediate cover, and 71% for final cover. Direct measurement
        of landfill methane emissions is preferrable to account for the full
        range of variables driving landfill emissions, including collection
        system design and operation. However, applying these updated defaults
        back into the landfill emission models eliminates underprediction of
        landfill emissions for the dataset reviewed, and would provide a more
        accurate estimate of landfill gas emissions where measurements are
        unavailable.

      abstract: Fugitive natural gas leaks from abnormal operations or failed
        containment at oil and gas production fields and gas supply chains are a
        significant source of atmospheric methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse
        gas. This realization of significant CH4 leaks has stimulated efforts at
        mitigation using cost effective detection methods. US DOE's ARPA-E
        MONITOR program has supported transformational research to locate and
        quantify fugitive methane leaks at natural gas facilities in order to
        achieve a 90% reduction in CH4 emissions. This paper describes the
        development, application, and evaluation of a MONITOR program sponsored
        source attribution technology solution, wherein an artificial neural
        network (ANN) infers as outputs, a leak location and release rate given
        inputs of measured sonic anemometer wind velocities and methane sensor
        time series. We discuss development of our ANN model, its training,
        computational implementation and use to design effective sampling
        strategies over a range of source and sensor locations, and
        meteorological conditions. We report on the deployment and performance
        of our ALFaLDS in blind tests at Colorado State University's METEC well
        pad facility in Ft. Collins. Test results demonstrate that our ALFaLDS
        locates the engineered methane leaks to better than 8% of the domain
        length scale and has the ability to quantify fluxes, more accurately at
        high flux rates, less so at low rates. Our ANN overestimates leak source
        rates by an average scale factor of about 1.83 for small pads and by an
        average of 1.77 for larger domains. The scale factor can be used
        operationally but needs more research to assess its generality. This
        capability of leak location with high skill, speed and accuracy at
        moderate cost promises new automatic affordable sampling of fugitive gas
        leaks at well pads and oil and gas fields.

      abstract: During the entire growth cycle of fruit trees, it is essential to
        implement management practices, including pruning, irrigation, pest and

        has largely depended on subjective judgment and growers' experience,
        often lacking scientific rigor and demanding considerable labor and

        advance orchard management through intelligent, digital, and automated
        systems, thereby reducing labor intensity, enhancing scientific
        decision-making, and improving farmers’ income. Timely and accurate
        acquisition of information on fruit tree growth is a prerequisite for
        implementing intelligent orchard management. Unmanned aerial vehicle

        monitoring, offering significant advantages such as high

        management, encompassing critical tasks such as pest and disease
        monitoring, irrigation management, canopy pruning, flower and fruit

      abstract: This paper proposes a novel data processing scheme for electronic
        noses that combines the gramian angular field (GAF) and convolutional
        neural network (CNN) to achieve high performance in classifying five
        levels of odor intensity. Specifically, a multi-channel e-nose was
        developed to detect various gases, including hydrogen sulfide, ammonia,
        sulfur dioxide, trimethylamine, and alkane gases, among others, in
        complex odor components. The sensor array was optimized through Spearman
        correlation analysis of the sensor signals and artificial olfactory odor
        intensity levels. Moreover, the one-dimensional temporal sensor data was
        converted into two-dimensional color images using the GAF (GASF/GADF)
        algorithm. This approach enables a more detailed presentation of deep
        features while retaining the time-domain dependence of the signals. To
        enhance the performance of classification, a multi-scale feature fusion
        network (MFFNet) was designed. Notably, GASF-converted images are more
        effective in characterizing sensor data for different odor intensity
        levels than GADF-converted images. Compared to classical CNN
        classification models such as AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet18, MFFNet
        achieved the highest accuracy and macro average F1-score on the test
        set, which were 93.75% and 93.34%, respectively. The results demonstrate
        the efficient classification of odor intensity levels by combining
        multi-channel e-nose technology, GASF, and CNN.

      abstract: "Natural gas leaks alter both the spectral reflectance and the
        structure of surface vegetation, which can be used to indirectly monitor
        microleakages in gas storage facilities. However, existing methods

        In this study, the utility of mobile LiDAR in detecting vegetation

        analyzing LiDAR data from a field experiment with bean and grass plants
        in their growing phase. A method utilizing the Jeffries-Matusita

        proposed, which comprises three main steps: First, response of
        vegetation structure characteristic to natural gas stress was
        quantitatively analyzed at plot and pixel scales using LiDAR data.
        Second, the optimal set of structure characteristic parameters
        indicating natural gas stressed vegetation was determined using

      abstract: "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), such as quadcopters, have become

        paper presents a state estimation approach for quadcopters based on PF
        integrated with an inner-outer loops controller to achieve precise
        positioning and trajectory tracking. The study aims to validate the
        efficiency of the proposed PF-based algorithm for UAV state estimation,

        simulations using the Julia programming language were conducted for a

        that the PF algorithm effectively estimated the drone’s state, allowing

      abstract: Accurate quantification of methane emissions from landfills is crucial
        for improving greenhouse gas inventories and mitigating climate change
        impacts. Existing methodologies, such as theoretical gas production
        models and labour-intensive measurement approaches, present limitations
        including large uncertainties and high operational costs. This study
        adds to a growing body of research and applications which aim to bridge
        this gap. To this end, we present a case study using Unmanned Aerial
        Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with methane and wind instrumentation for a
        survey of a landfill site in Bury, Manchester, UK, in summer 2022, in
        order to evaluate and reflect the challenges of the UAV-based mass
        balance method for quantification of methane emissions from a large
        heterogeneous source such as landfill. This study offers guidance on
        defining an appropriate methane background concentration, geospatial
        interpolation of sampled date, survey sampling strategy, and more
        importantly, addresses the challenges surrounding UAV wind measurements
        and spatial characterisation of emission plumes. For the period of the

        is crucial for improving greenhouse gas inventories and mitigating
        climate change impacts. Existing methodologies, such as theoretical gas
        production models and labour-intensive measurement approaches, present
        limitations including large uncertainties and high operational costs.
        This study adds to a growing body of research and applications which aim
        to bridge this gap. To this end, we present a case study using Unmanned
        Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with methane and wind instrumentation
        for a survey of a landfill site in Bury, Manchester, UK, in summer 2022,
        in order to evaluate and reflect the challenges of the UAV-based mass
        balance method for quantification of methane emissions from a large
        heterogeneous source such as landfill. This study offers guidance on
        defining an appropriate methane background concentration, geospatial
        interpolation of sampled date, survey sampling strategy, and more
        importantly, addresses the challenges surrounding UAV wind measurements
        and spatial characterisation of emission plumes. For the period of the
        case study, we quantified methane flux for the landfill site to be

        83.0 kg h−1 to 209.5 kg h−1.}

      abstract: Sewage odour is a common pollution odour source produced by urban
        water bodies and negatively impacts people’s behaviour. This study aimed
        to explore whether sound could change this negative effect. Therefore, a
        behaviour-observation experiment was conducted in a typical urban
        waterfront park using the sewage odour as the source of the pollution
        smell and playing typical sound sources in urban environments (music and
        fan sounds) with and without odour. The results showed that for crowd
        paths, music could significantly attract a crowd, fan sound or sewage
        odour could keep the crowd away. Furthermore, when there was sewage
        odour, the effects of the trends of approaching or receding from the
        sound sources caused by the music and fan sounds, respectively, have
        been strengthened. Sound and odour had relatively independent impacts on
        the crowd speed and duration time, reflected in the fact that music
        significantly reduced the crowd speed whereas fan sound and sewage odour
        significantly improved it. Music significantly increased the crowd
        duration time, while fan sound and sewage odour significantly reduced
        it. On this basis, the independent effects of sound and odour were
        superimposed, and the positive effect of music was stronger than the
        negative effect of sewage odour.

      abstract: The outdoor storage of wood chips, used in biomass thermal power
        plants, may lead to different diffuse gaseous emissions. These emissions
        can contain different molecules, often with a non-negligible odour
        potential. Despite this need, these solid area sources are particularly
        complex to be characterised, due to their very high heterogeneity
        determined by a complex phenomenon of self-heating. Previous studies
        have reported the correlation between specific odorous emission
        potential and surface temperature, detected via thermal camera. The
        present study aims to propose and explore the use of a thermal camera
        drone to obtain an entire thermal map for lignocellulosic storage and
        correlate the obtained data with specific emission rates. The field
        direct sampling, conducted via flux chamber, has confirmed a link
        between surface temperature and odorous emission for this kind of
        source. Moreover, the thermograms have made possible a short-cut
        quantitative estimation of an overall emission rate, crucial for the
        calculation of odour impact assessment at the receptors.

      abstract: A large quantity of CH4 is emitted to the atmosphere via ventilation
        shafts of underground coal mines. According to the European Pollutant
        Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR), hard coal mines in the Upper
        Silesia Coal Basin (USCB) are a strong contributor (447 kt CH4 in 2017)
        to the annual European CH4 emissions. However, atmospheric emissions of
        CH4 from coal mines are poorly characterized, as they are dispersed over
        large areas. As part of the Carbon Dioxide and CH4 Mission (CoMet)
        pre-campaign, a study of the USCB's regional CH4 emissions took place in
        August 2017. We flew a recently developed active AirCore system aboard
        an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to obtain CH4 mole fractions downwind
        of a single coal mining ventilation shaft. Besides CH4, we also measured
        CO2, CO, atmospheric temperature, pressure, and relative humidity.
        Wind-speed and wind-direction measurements were made using a lightweight
        balloon-borne radiosonde. Fifteen UAV flights were performed flying
        perpendicular to the wind direction at several altitude levels, to
        effectively build a ‘curtain’ of CH4 mole fractions in a two-dimensional
        plane at a distance between 150 and 350 m downwind of a single
        ventilation shaft. Furthermore, we have developed an inverse Gaussian
        approach for quantifying CH4 emissions from a point source using the
        UAV-based observations, and have applied it as well as the mass balance
        approach to both simulated data and actual flight data to quantify CH4
        emissions. The simulated data experiments revealed the importance of
        having multiple transects at different altitudes, appropriate vertical
        spacing between the individual transects, and proper distance between
        the center height of the plume and the center flight transect. They also
        showed that the inverse Gaussian approach performed better than the mass
        balance approach. Our estimate of the CH4 emission rates from the
        sampled shaft ranges from 0.5 to 14.5 kt/year using a mass balance
        approach, and between 1.1 and 9.0 kt/year using an inverse Gaussian
        method. The average difference between the mass balance and the inverse
        Gaussian approach was 2.3 kt/year. Based on the observed correlation
        between CO2 and CH4 (R-squared > 0.69), the CO2 emissions from the shaft
        were estimated to be between 0.3 and 9.8 kt/year. This study
        demonstrates that the UAV-based active AirCore system provides an
        effective way of quantifying coal mining shaft emissions of CH4 and CO2.

        9.0 kt/year using an inverse Gaussian method. The average difference
        between the mass balance and the inverse Gaussian approach was
        2.3 kt/year. Based on the observed correlation between CO2 and CH4
        (R-squared > 0.69), the CO2 emissions from the shaft were estimated to
        be between 0.3 and 9.8 kt/year. This study demonstrates that the
        UAV-based active AirCore system provides an effective way of quantifying
        coal mining shaft emissions of CH4 and CO2.}

      abstract: In this paper, we introduce a nano aerial robot swarm for indoor air
        quality monitoring applications such as occupational health and safety
        of (industrial) workplaces. The concept combines a robotic swarm
        composing of nano Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (nano UAVs), based on the
        Crazyflie 2.0 quadrocopter, and small lightweight metal oxide gas
        sensors for measuring the Total Volatile Organic Compound (TVOC) in ppb
        and estimating the eCO2 (equivalent calculated carbon-dioxide)
        concentration in ppm. TVOC is a measure for the indoor air quality. An
        indoor localization and positioning system will be used to estimate the
        absolute 3D position of the swarm like GPS. Based on this novel indoor
        air quality monitoring concept, the development and validation of new
        algorithms in the field of Mobile Robot Olfaction (MRO) are planned,

      abstract: The rapid and continuous growth of the Internet of Things has led to a
        rising demand for processing and storage solutions that can overcome the
        limitations of user devices. While cloud computing provides scalability,
        it often introduces considerable delay. To address this challenge, a
        computing paradigm that brings resources closer to user devices is
        preferable. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as an effective
        solution to enhance communication quality and coverage in wireless
        systems, particularly in specific conditions. This paper presents a
        UAV-enabled Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) system, where UAVs equipped with
        computational capabilities provide task offloading services to users. In
        this system, users process part of their computing tasks locally, while
        offloading the remaining tasks to UAVs for processing. The primary goal
        of the proposed algorithm is to minimize processing delays, taking into
        account the environmental and energy constraints of the UAVs, such as
        movement boundaries, link blockages, transmission delays, and battery
        consumption for computation and flight. To achieve this, we propose a
        Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm based on the Rainbow Deep
        Q-Network. This algorithm explores the dynamic and stochastic
        environment of MEC to deploy an appropriate computation offloading
        policy. The extensive experiments conducted in this study demonstrate
        the superior performance of the proposed method. The results show fast
        convergence to an optimal value and an average improvement of 12.63
        percent in delay compared to state-of-the-art methods.

        has led to a rising demand for processing and storage solutions that can
        overcome the limitations of user devices. While cloud computing provides
        scalability, it often introduces considerable delay. To address this
        challenge, a computing paradigm that brings resources closer to user
        devices is preferable. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as
        an effective solution to enhance communication quality and coverage in
        wireless systems, particularly in specific conditions. This paper
        presents a UAV-enabled Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) system, where UAVs
        equipped with computational capabilities provide task offloading
        services to users. In this system, users process part of their computing
        tasks locally, while offloading the remaining tasks to UAVs for
        processing. The primary goal of the proposed algorithm is to minimize
        processing delays, taking into account the environmental and energy
        constraints of the UAVs, such as movement boundaries, link blockages,
        transmission delays, and battery consumption for computation and flight.
        To achieve this, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm
        based on the Rainbow Deep Q-Network. This algorithm explores the dynamic
        and stochastic environment of MEC to deploy an appropriate computation
        offloading policy. The extensive experiments conducted in this study
        demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. The results
        show fast convergence to an optimal value and an average improvement of
        12.63 percent in delay compared to state-of-the-art methods.}

      abstract: Odor issues from landfills remain a persistent environmental
        challenge, exacerbated by the increasing urbanization and the decreasing
        proximity of residential areas to waste disposal sites. Conventional
        odor measurement methods (e.g., olfactometry, gas chromatography-mass
        spectrometry) have been instrumental in studying landfill emissions and
        addressing odor complaints. However, these methods either rely on
        subjective human assessment or require bulky equipment, limiting their
        large-scale applications on landfill sites. Additionally, real-time odor
        measurement is hindered by the need for on-site air sampling followed by
        detailed panel or lab analysis. To overcome these limitations, there is
        a need to modernize landfill odor assessment through automation,
        enabling air sampling and analysis with rapid response to odor
        complaints. Scaling these odor sensors for instantaneous, widespread
        measurement presents challenges due to the complex and highly variable

        This work explores the current state-of-the-art olfactory-based and

        the future convergence of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven analytics,
        hybrid sensor technologies, and cost-effective scalable solutions to

      abstract: Pipelines are the most efficient means of transporting water, oil,
        gas, and other fluids. Nevertheless, the occurrence of pipeline leaks
        can lead to significant resource wastage and pose a threat to public
        health and safety. It is crucial to ensure that leaks are detected and

        Despite a plethora of studies over the past decade, a comprehensive
        overview of ML-based pipeline leak detection technologies is yet to be
        developed. To address this gap, this study undertakes a bibliometric
        analysis to systematically review relevant research papers. The analysis
        reveals an increasing use of ML in leak detection applications. This
        paper primarily focuses on recent advancements in the application of ML
        for detecting leaks in oil, gas, and water pipelines. Additionally, it
        consolidates existing literature, identifies research limitations, and

      keywords: Hazardous chemical leakage, Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), Gas leakage
        traceability & dispersion (GLTD), Improve sparrow search algorithm
        (ISSA), Improved Gaussian plume model
      abstract: Rapid prediction of gas leakage traceability & dispersion (GLTD) is
        critical for the emergency management of chemical industrial parks
        (CIPs). Existing GLTD prediction methods are limited by the spatial
        coverage and number of fixed gas sensors. It is also not possible to
        provide any specific information about the leak scene. Inspired by
        emerging drone technologies, this work proposed an advanced UAV-driven
        GLTD prediction methodology. The dispersion concentration field of the
        hazardous chemical leakage is simulated based on an improved Gaussian
        plume model, and then high precision and efficiency prediction is
        achieved by an improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA), which can
        periodically update the flight strategy of UAVs. The proposed
        methodology is validated by a case study of a CIP in China. The results
        indicate that, compared with the traditional fixed sensors-driven
        strategy based on PSO, GA and SSA, the involvement of UAVs based on ISSA
        can reduce the prediction errors by 86.7%, 88.2% and 53.4%. Further
        analysis is conducted on the impact of algorithm parameters (UAV
        locations, number of UAVs, sampling frequency and step size) on search
        efficiency. The optimal algorithm parameters are discussed from the

        abstract = {Rapid prediction of gas leakage traceability & dispersion
        (GLTD) is critical for the emergency management of chemical industrial
        parks (CIPs). Existing GLTD prediction methods are limited by the
        spatial coverage and number of fixed gas sensors. It is also not
        possible to provide any specific information about the leak scene.
        Inspired by emerging drone technologies, this work proposed an advanced
        UAV-driven GLTD prediction methodology. The dispersion concentration
        field of the hazardous chemical leakage is simulated based on an
        improved Gaussian plume model, and then high precision and efficiency
        prediction is achieved by an improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA),
        which can periodically update the flight strategy of UAVs. The proposed
        methodology is validated by a case study of a CIP in China. The results
        indicate that, compared with the traditional fixed sensors-driven
        strategy based on PSO, GA and SSA, the involvement of UAVs based on ISSA
        can reduce the prediction errors by 86.7%, 88.2% and 53.4%. Further
        analysis is conducted on the impact of algorithm parameters (UAV
        locations, number of UAVs, sampling frequency and step size) on search
        efficiency. The optimal algorithm parameters are discussed from the
        perspectives of cost effectiveness and computational efficiency. This
        work has the potentials to assist in constructing an intelligent
        emergency decision support system for CIPs.}

      abstract: A portable methane sensor system based on tunable diode laser
        absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) was developed to detect natural gas
        leakages in various pipeline systems. To facilitate the development and
        integration of the portable laser gas sensor system, an
        optical-alignment-free laser gas sensor module based on mini carbon
        fiber multi-pass cell with dimensions of 8.5 × 4 × 4 cm³ and an
        effective optical path length of 4.85 m was designed, demonstrating high
        structural stability. The design of the open cavity structure
        accelerates gas response time on the one hand and reduces system
        complexity on the other by eliminating the need for additional equipment
        such as pumps. A temperature compensation theoretical model based on
        Lorentzian line shape is used to correct the influence of temperature on
        the measurement signal of the sensor system. The portable methane sensor
        system achieved a minimum detection limit of ∼94 ppb for CH4
        concentration measurements, with dimensions of 22 × 20 × 7 cm3, a weight
        of 1182 g and a power consumption of 1.8 W. An atmospheric methane
        mobile monitoring experiment on the campus of Shanxi University
        validated the feasibility and portability of the portable methane sensor
        system for CH4 concentration real-time monitoring. This portable methane
        sensor system was deployed within the front frame of an electric vehicle
        and conducted mobile monitoring of twenty-five natural gas pipeline
        monitoring points in urban areas. Five pipeline leak detection points
        were identified during the monitoring process, thus validating the
        reliability and potential application prospects of the portable methane
        sensor system for natural gas pipeline leak detection.

      keywords: Leak localization, Dataset construction, Artificial neural networks,
        District Heating Networks
      abstract: Leaks in district heating networks result in waste of water and heat,
        and even threaten personal safety. Various machine learning-based
        methods have been proposed to realize leak localization and gain
        satisfying performance based on a large amount of leak samples. However,
        the creation of such samples demands a substantial investment of time
        and computational resources, presenting challenges for real-time
        applications. Previous studies have rarely addressed the influence of
        leak dataset construction and efficient creation methods. To fill this
        limited area, this paper conducts a comparative analysis on the
        variables in leak dataset and proposes an effective method for sample
        dataset generation, complemented by a novel accuracy evaluation that
        incorporates the topological relationship among pipelines. A
        multi-source looped heating network is employed to do the case study.
        The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory
        leak localization performance with a significantly reduced training set.
        Furthermore, by segmenting the physical pipeline into multiple virtual
        pipelines and using the adjacent evaluation metric, the leak
        localization method achieves a 75 m error with an accuracy of 0.998.

      abstract: This study introduces the innovative concepts of the cooperation
        between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and automated guided vehicles
        (AGVs) in remote toxic gas sensing and alarming schemes in a smart
        factory. Initially, the UAV is dispatched in different directions to
        detect toxic gas leakage on the fly in the smart factory premises.
        However, due to the UAVs’ concern about smokeless and high-density gas
        detection capabilities, AGVs are proposed to cooperate with UAVs in the
        smart factory, especially in the basement areas. Because of their
        limited computational power, UAVs and AGVs securely transfer sensor data
        to a nearby multi-access edge computing (MEC) server for processing. A
        hybrid cryptographic technique and unique data authentication mechanisms
        are exploited to ensure security while transmitting the data in this
        proposed scheme. Subsequently, the MEC server automatically triggers an
        emergency alarm during toxic gas leakage to alert all the employees
        inside the boundaries of the smart factory. The implementation results
        exhibit that the proposed scheme can successfully sense toxic gas
        leakage using UAVs and AGVs, securely transfer the data to the MEC
        server to process, and enhance the overall quality of service compared
        with the other existing literature. Finally, the outcome analysis
        demonstrates that the proposed scheme is more worthwhile and has

        UAVs to fly autonomously, we will see swarms of UAV populating the sky
        of our smart cities to accomplish different missions: parcel delivery,
        infrastructure monitoring, event filming, surveillance, tracking, etc.
        The UAV ecosystem can benefit from 5G/B5G cellular networks, which can
        be exploited in different ways to enhance UAV communications. Because of
        the inherent characteristics of UAV pertaining to flexible mobility in
        3D space, autonomous operation and intelligent placement, these smart
        devices cater to wide range of wireless applications and use cases. This
        work aims at presenting an in-depth exploration of integration synergies
        between 5G/B5G cellular systems and UAV technology, where the UAV is
        integrated as a new aerial User Equipment (UE) to already deployed
        cellular networks. In this integration, the UAVs perform the role of
        flying users within cellular coverage, thus they are termed as
        cellular-connected UAVs. The main focus of this work is to present an
        extensive study of integration challenges along with key 5G/B5G
        technological innovations and ongoing efforts in design prototyping and
        field trials corroborating cellular-connected UAVs. This study
        highlights recent progress updates with respect to 3GPP standardization
        and emphasizes socio-economic concerns that must be accounted before
        successful adoption of this promising technology. Various open problems

      abstract: Greenhouse gases (GHGs) from agriculture in Africa are among the
        world's fastest-growing emissions, with the livestock sector as the
        primary contributor. However, the methods for quantifying these
        emissions rely on manual and outdated data collection and processing
        approaches. Therefore, there is a need to develop more accurate and
        efficient methods of quantifying GHGs from livestock. This research
        developed a remote sensing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) based
        approach to quantify GHG emissions from cattle in the Kisombwa Ranching
        Scheme in Mubende District, central Uganda. We trained a deep learning
        algorithm, You Only Look Once (YOLO) v4, to detect cattle from the
        Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images of the study area and applied the
        Simple Online Real-time Tracker (SORT) algorithm for automated counting.
        Methane (CH4) and Nitrous Oxide (N2O) emissions from manure management
        and enteric fermentation were estimated using the number of cattle and
        the Tier 1 guidelines from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
        (IPCC). The total estimated emissions were 321,121.34 kg carbon dioxide
        equivalent (CO2eq) per year, with CH4 at 282,282.96 kg CO2eq per year
        (88 %) and N2O at 38,838.38 kg CO2eq per year (12 %). Enteric
        fermentation contributed the highest emissions, about 99 % of the total
        CH4 emissions and 87 % of the total GHGs. The proposed remote sensing
        and AI-driven method achieved an average F1 score of 88.9 %, average
        precision of 97 %, and average recall of 82.9 % on the testing set of
        images. Therefore, these research findings demonstrate that remote
        sensing and AI are a more potent and efficient approach to upscale
        quantifying and reporting animal population and livestock GHG emissions
        for sustainable agriculture and climate change mitigation.

      abstract: Natural gas pipeline leakage can cause significant economic losses and
        even jeopardize public safety. Therefore, leakage detection technology
        is crucial. In this study, the pipeline source term estimation method is
        proposed to identify the source of natural gas pipeline leakage. The
        method combines the modified Gaussian plume model, the unmanned aerial
        vehicle inspection technology equipped with laser methane sensors, and
        the Markov chain Monte Carlo method based on Bayesian inference.
        Different from traditional leak detection techniques, this method can
        simultaneously obtain the location and rate of pipeline leakage. The
        accuracy of the method is validated by using simulated data from the
        modified Gaussian plume model, which can be employed to replace
        experimental tests. Convergence diagnosis and model evaluation are
        performed on the inversion model in this method, verifying its
        rationality and feasibility. The impact of system errors on the pipeline
        source estimation method is analyzed, revealing that the accuracy of
        inversion can be improved by using prior information and ensuring the
        reliability of the forward gas dispersion model and monitoring data. The
        pipeline source term estimation method proposed in this paper can offer
        technical support for the emergency treatment of natural gas pipeline
        leakage accidents.

      abstract: Robotic odor source localization (OSL) has been viewed as a
        challenging task due to the turbulent nature of airflows and the
        resulting odor plume characteristics. The key to solving an OSL problem
        is designing an effective olfactory-based navigation algorithm, which
        guides a plume-tracing robot to find the odor source via tracing emitted
        plumes. Inspired by the mate-seeking behaviors of male moths, this
        article presents a behavior-based navigation algorithm for using on a
        mobile robot to locate an odor source in an unknown environment. Unlike
        traditional bio-inspired algorithms, which use fixed parameters to
        formulate robot search trajectories, we design a fuzzy controller to
        perceive the environment and adjust trajectory parameters based on the
        current search situation. Therefore, the robot can automatically adapt
        the scale of search trajectories to fit environmental changes and
        balance the exploration and exploitation of the search. Simulation and
        on-vehicle results show that compared to two classical olfactory-based
        navigation algorithms, the proposed algorithm is more efficient and
        outperforms them in terms of the averaged search time and success rate.

      abstract: The accurate and comprehensive identification and quantification of
        greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is an essential part of the management
        and mitigation of climate change. We are developing a novel remote gas
        imaging sensor for the detection, visualisation, and quantification of
        methane emissions. The sensor uses a new technique we call Tunable Diode
        Lidar (TDLidar) which combines aspects of Tunable Diode Laser Absorption
        Spectroscopy (TDLAS) with Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) and Time
        Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) to enable remote spectroscopy
        and ranging with low power semiconductor diode lasers. Our first TDLidar
        methane sensors use diode lasers with wavelengths around the CH4
        absorption line at 1.6509 μm and Peltier-cooled Single Photon Avalanche
        Diode (SPAD) detectors in a Random Modulation Continuous Wave (RM-CW)
        Lidar system. Here we characterise our TDLidar methane sensor
        performance with calibrated gas cells and controlled gas release trials
        and we demonstrate quantification of leak rates as low as 0.012 g/s and
        detection at distances over 90 m. The accuracy, speed, and practicality
        of the sensor, combined with an expectation of low-cost in volume,
        offers the potential that these sensors can be effectively applied for
        widespread continuous and autonomous monitoring of industrial methane
        emissions.

      abstract: The localization of a source emitting gas to the outdoor atmosphere
        has many applications for air quality monitoring and chemical hazard
        mitigation. Chemical Plume Tracing (CPT) refers to the utilization of
        autonomous robotic platforms equipped with chemical and anemometry
        sensors to preform this task. Numerical simulations are an important
        tool in the development of CPT algorithms. Here, for the first time,
        high fidelity environmental simulations of the Atmospheric Boundary
        Layer (ABL) are utilized for the study of CPT algorithm. Large Eddy
        Simulation (LES) modeling using the PALM model is applied for producing
        high-resolution three-dimensional flow and dispersion simulations of the
        outdoor ABL. A CPT bio-inspired algorithm is simulated on top of the
        modeled environment. Multiple tests are conducted, following statistical
        analysis of the overall performance. The advantage of the suggested
        modeling framework over former used methods is exemplified through the
        study of two issues. First, a theoretical optimal velocity of the
        robotic platform is quantitatively estimated. Secondly, based on the
        three-dimensional nature of LES modeling, an extension of the CPT
        algorithm, aimed for the localization of elevated sources, is presented
        and tested. The comparison of CPT performance for elevated versus ground

      abstract: Considering autonomous searching for an unknown source in complex
        hazardous environments while balancing search efficiency and flight
        safety, this paper proposes a framework called source seeking with
        cumulative exposure minimization (SSCEM) for an unmanned aerial vehicle
        (UAV) equipped with gas sensors. First, the hazardous substance
        dispersion is formulated by using an isotropic plume model, and the
        stochastic sensor measurement in turbulent environments is modeled as a
        Poisson distribution. Second, the source term including the source
        location and release rate, is estimated by using a Bayesian inference
        framework. A particle filter is adopted to reduce the computational
        burden. Third, as cumulative exposure to hazardous fields can lead to
        airborne device failures and endanger flight safety, to achieve a
        reasonable trade-off among exploitation, exploration and flight safety,
        SSCEM for UAVs is proposed based on information theory and an interfered
        fluid dynamical system (IFDS), where heuristic action candidates in a
        continuous domain and a cost function considering cumulative exposure
        collectively drive the UAV to approach the unknown source location while
        reducing cumulative exposure, and no-fly zone avoidance is realized
        using the IFDS. Eventually, source seeking is efficiently performed by
        the UAV with no-fly zone avoidance and kinematic requirements being met,
        and comparative simulation results demonstrate the performance of SSCEM.

      abstract: Improving the mitigation of global greenhouse effects requires drastic
        reductions in carbon emissions. Effective carbon management at different
        spatial scales is therefore crucial to a more sustainable path of
        economic development. Regional and local carbon management currently
        rely on the traditional bottom-up method of emission reports, which are
        known for their opaque and complex procedures. Novel top-down carbon
        monitoring methods including space-based, aerial and ground-based
        observations are tantalising alternatives to more reliable data sources
        of carbon emissions as well as sinks. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
        based carbon monitoring is an upcoming field because of its lower costs,
        higher spatial-temporal resolution and operability at a wider range of
        weather conditions compared to satellite observations. UAVs equipped
        with Non-dispersive Infrared (NDIR) carbon dioxide (CO2) sensors can
        measure in the air with faster response and can intelligently navigate
        themselves within areas of greater interest. With the help of lighter
        NDIR payloads and multiple UAVs flying in synchrony, larger cross
        sections or areas for maximising information acquisition of emission
        plumes can be covered. In this article, we first introduce the design of
        a miniaturised NDIR payload, which is compatible with a lightweight UAV
        to achieve a single system weighing less than 4 kg. Then, we test our
        design via comparisons against another NDIR payload to determine its
        accuracy (−0.82 ppm and −0.44 ppm) and precision (0.12 ppm and
        −0.03 ppm) in measurements of two vertical concentration profiles.
        Finally, we deployed four UAVs on two major anthropogenic emission
        source monitoring campaigns with coordinated flight patterns. To fully
        understand the benefit of multi-UAV carbon monitoring, we attempted two
        flight patterns and computed power plant emission rates via the
        cross-sectional flux method. While all flights successfully captured the
        concentration enhancements downwind of the power plants, the
        single-sectional flight pattern measured an emission rate of 10ktCO2/day
        which is 44% less than that reported monthly and the multi-sectional
        flight pattern yielded relatively varied results (8.5ktCO2/day on
        average, which is 54% less) for the respective sections due to wind
        underestimations, plume section undersampling and wind fluctuations.

      abstract: This study addresses the challenge of efficient monitoring of ship
        exhaust emissions in inland waterways by proposing an optimized approach
        to selecting bridge-based monitoring points. A micro-scale Computational
        Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was developed to simulate interactions
        between ship exhaust plumes and river-crossing bridges, enabling precise
        predictions of dispersion patterns and concentrations. A numerical model
        incorporating pre-defined monitoring points and local environmental data
        was used to evaluate the influence of wind, water levels, and ship
        dynamics on plume behavior. The model's feasibility was validated
        through on-site UAV experiments. Results showed that plume dispersion is
        significantly affected by wind direction, wind speed, water level, and
        ship speed. Under extreme low water levels, the proposed three-point
        monitoring setup achieved a detection probability of 61.47 %, with
        performance improving as water levels increased. This study enhances
        monitoring accuracy and efficiency for riverine areas, providing a
        valuable tool for precise regulation of ship-emitted pollutants and
        supporting sustainable inland waterway management.

        A numerical model incorporating pre-defined monitoring points and local
        environmental data was used to evaluate the influence of wind, water
        levels, and ship dynamics on plume behavior. The model's feasibility was
        validated through on-site UAV experiments. Results showed that plume
        dispersion is significantly affected by wind direction, wind speed,
        water level, and ship speed. Under extreme low water levels, the
        proposed three-point monitoring setup achieved a detection probability
        of 61.47 %, with performance improving as water levels increased. This
        study enhances monitoring accuracy and efficiency for riverine areas,

        pollutants and supporting sustainable inland waterway management.}

      abstract: Enhancement of methane emission measurement techniques is necessary to
        address the need for greenhouse gas emissions monitoring. Here we
        introduce a gas analyzer designed for remote sensing of atmospheric
        methane aboard unmanned aerial vehicles. This device employs the
        wavelength modulation laser spectroscopy approach and quadrature
        detection of laser radiation scattered from the underlying surface. This
        method is conceptually similar to the operating principle of lidar-based
        rangefinders, and the device also provides distance measurement
        capabilities. Our results demonstrate that the observed correlation
        between various signal attributes and the distance to the surface, where
        laser radiation scatters, aligns with analytical expectations.
        Calibrations proved that the instrument provides reliable methane
        measurements up to 120 m while being lightweight and power efficient.
        The presented device operates at a sampling rate of 19 Hz and achieves a
        measurement resolution of 15 ppm⋅m at an altitude of 50 m. Notably, this
        device surpasses its competitors in performance at higher altitudes,
        which offer greater safety for piloting.

        leakage can cause economic losses and safety hazards, making its
        accurate detection and quantification a critical issue in the natural

        (TDLAS) to measure the path-integrated concentration of atmospheric CH4.
        The wavelength modulation spectroscopy with first harmonic normalized

        The key to active imaging is a pan-tilt unit integrating the standoff
        CH4 sensor, a laser rangefinder, and a visible camera. With 2D scanning,
        CH4 concentration data, ranging data, and pan-tilt angular data are
        fused to generate a pseudo-color map of CH4 concentration. Further, the
        CH4 leakage rate is estimated by a mass balance algorithm based on the
        wind speed data collected by an anemometer. The imaging quality and
        quantification accuracy were evaluated by targeting calibrated CH4 gas

        0.1 g/s at 30 m range and quantify leaks with accuracy better than 10 %
        at 10 m range, which demonstrates its potential for application in the

      abstract: This paper describes the design, parametric study, and IR signature
        analysis of plume of a slit-shaped exhaust nozzle. Circular-shaped
        exhaust nozzles are generally used to get the essential thrust necessary
        for an aircraft flight. However, the Infrared (IR) signature of the
        exhaust plume emanating from these nozzles is very high, and the IR
        missile can easily lock and hit the aircraft. In this paper, the
        compressible flow CFD model using a realizable k-ε turbulence model is
        used to study the flow characteristics of the exhaust nozzle with
        different aspect ratios. The exit cross-section of the nozzle is kept
        elliptical up to a maximum aspect ratio of 10. IR signature for each
        nozzle shaped is calculated using a set of input parameters in Mid-wave
        IR and Long-wave IR spectral bands. The IR signature of exhaust plume in
        Long-wave IR spectral band is not significant due to high transmittance
        of species in the exhaust plume mixture. However, for this particular
        case of low flying UAV, a considerable reduction in the IR signature is
        recorded for the high aspect ratio nozzle in MWIR spectral band.

      abstract: Pipelines transport natural gas (NG) in all stages between production
        and the end user. The NG composition, pipeline depth, and pressure vary
        significantly between extraction and consumption. As methane (CH4), the
        primary component of NG is both explosive and a potent greenhouse gas,
        NG leaks from underground pipelines pose both a safety and environmental
        threat. Leaks are typically found when an observer detects a CH4
        enhancement as they pass through the downwind above-ground NG plume. The
        likelihood of detecting a plume depends, in part, on the size of the
        plume, which is contingent on both environmental conditions and
        intrinsic characteristics of the leak. To investigate the effects of
        leak characteristics, this study uses controlled NG release experiments
        to observe how the above-ground plume width changes with changes in the
        gas composition of the NG, leak rate, and depth of the subsurface
        emission. Results show that plume width generally decreases when heavier
        hydrocarbons are present, the leak rate is reduced, and as leak depth
        decreases from 0.9 to 0.6 m. The study illustrates that heavy gas leaks
        from flowlines and gathering lines could currently be more challenging
        to detect than leaks from distribution pipelines as the plume is trapped
        close to the ground. Further, this study shows that leaks from pipelines
        laid in covers meeting minimum depth requirements of 0.9 m could be
        easier to detect compared to those buried shallower. Overall, this study
        illustrates that leak survey protocols for flowlines and gathering lines
        should be different from distribution pipelines and tailored to the
        compositions of the transported NG to report emissions accurately. The
        study aims to improve the understanding of flowline/gathering line leaks
        to prevent fatal accidents, such as the 2017 explosion from a gathering
        line in Firestone, Colorado, that resulted in two fatalities and one
        injury.

      abstract: Weeds are undesirable plants that compete with crops for essential
        resources such as light, soil, water, and nutrients. Additionally, they
        can harbor pests that reduce crop yields. In traditional agriculture,
        weed control is based on applying pesticides throughout the agricultural
        field, resulting in soil damage, environmental contamination, damage to
        farm products, and risks to human health. Precision agriculture (PA) has
        evolved in recent years thanks to sensors, hardware, software, and
        innovations in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. These systems aim
        to improve the localized application of chemicals in weed control by
        using advanced image analysis techniques, computer vision, deep learning
        (DL), and geo-positioning (GPS) to detect and recognize weeds. This
        subsequently facilitates the implementation of specific control
        mechanisms in real environments. Recently, automatic weed detection
        techniques have been developed using UAV imagery. However, these face a
        significant challenge due to the morphological similarities between
        weeds and crops, such as color, shape, and texture, which makes their
        practical and effective differentiation and implementation difficult.
        This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) based on 77
        recent and relevant studies on weed detection and classification in UAV
        imagery using DL architectures. The analysis focuses on key aspects such
        as using UAVs and sensors, image acquisition and processing, DL
        architecture, and evaluation metrics. The review covers publications
        from 2017 to June 2024 from WoS, Scopus, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink,
        and IEEE Xplore databases. The results allowed the identification of
        various limitations, trends, gaps, and opportunities for future
        research. In general, there is a predominant use of multirotor UAVs,
        particularly the DJI Phantom with RGB sensors, showing a trend towards
        the integration of multiple sensors (multispectral, LiDAR) operating at
        heights of around 10 meters, providing good spatial coverage in data
        acquisition. Likewise, the rapid development of deep learning
        architectures has driven CNN models such as ResNet for classification,
        YOLO for detection, U-Net for semantic segmentation, and Mask R-CNN for
        weed instance segmentation, with a tendency towards new
        Transformer-based and hybrid architectures. The most common metrics used
        to evaluate these models include precision, recall, F1-Score, and mAP.

        abstract = {Weeds are undesirable plants that compete with crops for
        essential resources such as light, soil, water, and nutrients.
        Additionally, they can harbor pests that reduce crop yields. In
        traditional agriculture, weed control is based on applying pesticides
        throughout the agricultural field, resulting in soil damage,
        environmental contamination, damage to farm products, and risks to human
        health. Precision agriculture (PA) has evolved in recent years thanks to
        sensors, hardware, software, and innovations in unmanned aerial vehicle
        (UAV) systems. These systems aim to improve the localized application of
        chemicals in weed control by using advanced image analysis techniques,
        computer vision, deep learning (DL), and geo-positioning (GPS) to detect
        and recognize weeds. This subsequently facilitates the implementation of
        specific control mechanisms in real environments. Recently, automatic
        weed detection techniques have been developed using UAV imagery.
        However, these face a significant challenge due to the morphological
        similarities between weeds and crops, such as color, shape, and texture,
        which makes their practical and effective differentiation and
        implementation difficult. This paper presents a systematic literature
        review (SLR) based on 77 recent and relevant studies on weed detection
        and classification in UAV imagery using DL architectures. The analysis

      abstract: "Advanced leak detection (ALD) solutions for natural gas (NG) play a
        crucial role in swiftly identifying leaks to mitigate risks, costs, and
        methane (CH4) emissions. Despite recent advancements in CH4 leak
        detection, current ALD solutions often overlook the influence of
        subsurface and atmospheric conditions on gas behavior and, therefore,
        leak detection success. To address this gap, we conducted a series of
        controlled leak detection experiments under varying soil moisture levels
        and soil types, with two leak rates: low (0.5 slpm) and high (10 slpm),
        using walking, driving, and simulated UAV (UAVsim) surveys. The
        performance of these methods was evaluated using the probability of
        detection (POD). Results indicated that the POD of walking, driving, and
        UAVsim surveys is highly influenced by soil moisture and type. Low
        moisture conditions have a 10–45 % higher POD than high moisture
        conditions at higher leak rates, depending on the soil type and survey
        method. Higher permeability soils result in a 10–18 % higher POD than
        the lower-permeability soil tested within 5 m of the pipeline
        centerline. As the distance from the centerline increases, the magnitude
        of the impact grows, resulting in PODs 40–60 % lower than those along
        the centerline itself. Similarly, at low leak rates, the impact of high
        moisture and low permeability becomes more pronounced. Based on averages
        across all soil types and survey deployment platforms, the POD under dry
        soil conditions at a high leak rate is 20–40 % higher than at a low leak
        rate. Results further demonstrate the influence of the detection
        threshold, especially for low leak rates, where a 0.1 ppm increase in
        the detection threshold can reduce the POD by 50–60 % under moist soil
        conditions. These findings underscore the importance of considering the
        interplay between soil and operational conditions to enhance CH4 leak
        detection success. Emission measurement solutions can therefore use this
        knowledge to establish performance metrics that account for variations
        in soil conditions."

      abstract: Building a model of gas concentrations has important industrial and

        Since an exact analytical description of turbulent flow remains an
        intractable problem, we propose an approximate approach which not only
        estimates the concentrations but also their variances for each location.
        Our point of view is that of sequential Bayesian estimation given a
        lattice of 2D cells treated as hidden variables. We first discuss how a
        simple Kalman filter provides a solution to the estimation problem. To
        overcome the quadratic computational complexity with the mapped area
        exhibited by a straighforward application of Kalman filtering, we
        introduce a sparse implementation which runs in constant time.

      abstract: This paper presents an olfactory-based navigation algorithm via deep
        learning (DL) methods. The object is to obtain a neural network that
        navigates a mobile robot to find an odor source without explicating
        search strategies. Two deep neural networks (DNNs), including
        feedforward and long short-term memory neural networks (FNN and LSTM),
        are devised to calculate robot heading commands based on onboard sensor
        readings. The training dataset is obtained by implementing traditional
        olfactory-based navigation algorithms, namely moth-inspired and
        Bayesian-inference methods, on a mobile robot in hundreds of odor source
        localization (OSL) tests. After the supervised learning, DNNs are
        validated in real-world experiments with unseen odor source locations
        and airflow fields. Experiment results show that both FNN and LSTM can
        imitate the moth-inspired method but cannot effectively learn the
        complex Bayesian-inference method. In terms of the averaged search time
        in repeated tests, the proposed FNN and LSTM outperform the
        Bayesian-inference method by 18% and 14%, respectively, and both
        networks achieve a comparable search performance with the moth-inspired
        method.

        moth-inspired method but cannot effectively learn the complex
        Bayesian-inference method. In terms of the averaged search time in
        repeated tests, the proposed FNN and LSTM outperform the
        Bayesian-inference method by 18% and 14%, respectively, and both
        networks achieve a comparable search performance with the moth-inspired
        method.}}

      abstract: Gas source localization (GSL) by an olfactory robot is a research
        field with a great potential for applications but also with numerous
        unsolved challenges, particularly when the search must take place in
        realistic, indoor environments that feature obstacles and turbulent
        airflows. In this work, we present a new probabilistic GSL method for a
        terrestrial mobile robot that revolves around the propagation of local
        estimations throughout the environment. By exploiting the geometry of
        the environment as the basis for this propagation, we avoid relying on
        analytical dispersion models, eliminating the need to assume controlled
        environmental conditions. Simulated and real experiments are presented
        in different indoor environments featuring multiple rooms and turbulent
        flows, demonstrating the suitability of our approach for locating the
        emitting gas source.

      abstract: This work focuses on comparing gas source localization accuracy of
        three types of gas source localization methods which are the
        conventional method, weighted-averaging mean method and variance map
        from DM+V method. Gas source localization accuracy in this work means
        the distance error between the calculated source location and the actual
        source location. All methods were implemented offline using the
        measurements collected from real-time gas source localization
        experiments that were done beforehand. The dataset consists of gas
        sensor measurements, and mobile robot's location in a 3m by 6m test
        area. The goal of the work is to shine a light on why recent works in
        the field are more focusing on improving probabilistic and map-based
        algorithms. This work also shows how the kernel size of kernel-based gas
        distribution mapping might affect the gas source localization accuracy
        in a small indoor area.

      abstract: The use of robot swarms for odor source localization (OSL) can better
        adapt to the reality of unstable turbulence and find chemical
        contamination or hazard sources faster. Inspired by the collective
        behavior in nature, swarm intelligence (SI) is recognized as an
        appropriate algorithm framework for multi-robot system due to its
        parallelism, scalability and robustness. Applications of SI-based
        multi-robots for OSL problems have attracted great interest over the
        last two decades. In this review, we firstly summarize the trending
        issues in general robot OSL field through comparing some basic
        counterpart concepts, and then provide a detailed survey of various
        representative SI algorithms in multi-robot system for odor source
        localization. The research field originates from the first introduction
        of the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) and flourishes in
        applying ever-increasing quantity of its variants as modified PSOs and
        hybrid PSOs. Moreover, other nature-inspired SI algorithms have also
        demonstrated the diversity and exploration of this field. The computer
        simulations and real-world applications reported in the literatures show
        that those algorithms could well solve the main problems of odor source
        localization but still retain the potential for further development.
        Lastly, we provide an outlook on possible future research directions.

      abstract: This paper discusses odor source localization (OSL) using a mobile
        robot in an outdoor time-variant airflow environment. A novel OSL
        algorithm based on particle filters (PF) is proposed. When the odor
        plume clue is found, the robot performs an exploratory behavior, such as
        a plume-tracing strategy, to collect more information about the
        previously unknown odor source. In parallel, the information collected
        by the robot is exploited by the PF-based OSL algorithm to estimate the
        location of the odor source in real time. The process of the OSL is
        terminated if the estimated source locations converge within a given
        small area. The Bayesian-inference-based method is also performed for
        comparison. Experimental results indicate that the proposed PF-based OSL
        algorithm performs better than the Bayesian-inference-based OSL method.

      abstract: "This paper addresses the problem of estimating the spatial
        distribution of volatile substances using a mobile robot equipped with
        an electronic nose. Our work contributes an effective solution to two
        important problems that have been disregarded so far: First, obstacles
        in the environment (walls, furniture,...) do affect the gas spatial
        distribution. Second, when combining odor measurements taken at
        different instants of time, their `ages' must be taken into account to
        model the ephemeral nature of gas distributions. In order to incorporate
        these two characteristics into the mapping process we propose modeling
        the spatial distribution of gases as a Gaussian Markov random field.
        This mathematical framework allows us to consider both: (i) the
        vanishing information of gas readings by means of a time-increasing
        uncertainty in sensor measurements, and (ii) the influence of objects in
        the environment by means of correlations among the different areas.
        Experimental validation is provided with both, simulated and real-world
